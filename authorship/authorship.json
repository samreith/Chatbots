    "In his story Sarrasine, Balzac, speaking of a castrato disguised as a woman, writes this sentence: \"It was Woman, with her sudden fears, her irrational whims, her instinctive fears, her unprovoked bravado, her daring and her delicious delicacy of feeling\" Who is speaking in this way?", 
    "Is it the story's hero, concerned to ignore the castrato concealed beneath the woman?", 
    "Is it the man Balzac, endowed by his personal experience with a philosophy of Woman?", 
    "Is it the author Balzac, professing certain \"literary\" ideas of femininity?", 
    "Is it universal wisdom?", 
    "or romantic psychology?", 
    "It will always be impossible to know, for the good reason that all writing is itself this special voice, consisting of several indiscernible voices, and that literature is precisely the invention of this voice, to which we cannot assign a specific origin: literature is that neuter, that composite, that oblique into which every subject escapes, the trap where all identity is lost, beginning with the very identity of the body that writes.", 
    "Probably this has always been the case: once an action is recounted, for intransitive ends, and no longer in order to act directly upon reality \u2014 that is, finally external to any function but the very exercise of the symbol \u2014 this disjunction occurs, the voice loses its origin, the author enters his own death, writing begins.", 
    "Nevertheless, the feeling about this phenomenon has been variable;", 
    "in primitive societies, narrative is never undertaken by a person, but by a mediator, shaman or speaker, whose \"performance\" may be admired (that is, his mastery of the narrative code), but not his \"genius\" The author is a modern figure, produced no doubt by our society insofar as, at the end of the middle ages, with English empiricism, French rationalism and the personal faith of the Reformation, it discovered the prestige of the individual, or, to put it more nobly, of the \"human person\" Hence it is logical that with regard to literature it should be positivism, resume and the result of capitalist ideology, which has accorded the greatest importance to the author's \"person\" The author still rules in manuals of literary history, in biographies of writers, in magazine interviews, and even in the awareness of literary men, anxious to unite, by their private journals, their person and their work;", 
    "the image of literature to be found in contemporary culture is tyrannically centered on the author, his person, his history, his tastes, his passions;", 
    "criticism still consists, most of the time, in saying that Baudelaire's work is the failure of the man Baudelaire, Van Gogh's work his madness, Tchaikovsky's his vice: the explanation of the work is always sought in the man who has produced it, as if, through the more or less transparent allegory of fiction, it was always finally the voice of one and the same person, the author, which delivered his \"confidence.", 
    "\" Though the Author's empire is still very powerful (recent criticism has often merely consolidated it), it is evident that for a long time now certain writers have attempted to topple it.", 
    "In France, Mallarme was doubtless the first to see and foresee in its full extent the necessity of substituting language itself for the man who hitherto was supposed to own it;", 
    "for Mallarme, as for us, it is language which speaks, not the author: to write is to reach, through a preexisting impersonality \u2014 never to be confused with the castrating objectivity of the realistic novelist \u2014 that point where language alone acts, \"performs,\" and not \"oneself\": Mallarme's entire poetics consists in suppressing the author for the sake of the writing (which is, as we shall see, to restore the status of the reader.", 
    ") Valery, encumbered with a psychology of the Self, greatly edulcorated Mallarme's theory, but, turning in a preference for classicism to the lessons of rhetoric, he unceasingly questioned and mocked the Author, emphasized the linguistic and almost \"chance\" nature of his activity, and throughout his prose works championed the essentially verbal condition of literature, in the face of which any recourse to the writer's inferiority seemed to him pure superstition.", 
    "It is clear that Proust himself, despite the apparent psychological character of what is called his analyses, undertook the responsibility of inexorably blurring, by an extreme subtilization, the relation of the writer and his characters: by making the narrator not the person who has seen or felt, nor even the person who writes, but the person who will write (the young man of the novel \u2014 but, in fact, how old is he, and who is he?", 
    "\u2014 wants to write but cannot, and the novel ends when at last the writing becomes possible), Proust has given modern writing its epic: by a radical reversal, instead of putting his life into his novel, as we say so often, he makes his very life into a work for which his own book was in a sense the model, so that it is quite obvious to us that it is not Charlus who imitates Montesquiou, but that Montesquiou in his anecdotal, historical.", 
    "reality is merely a secondary fragment, derived from Charlus.", 
    "Surrealism lastly \u2014 to remain on the level of this prehistory of modernity \u2014 surrealism doubtless could not accord language a sovereign place, since language is a system and since what the movement sought was, romantically, a direct subversion of all codes \u2014 an illusory subversion, moreover, for a code cannot be destroyed, it can only be \"played with\";", 
    "but by abruptly violating expected meanings (this was the famous surrealist \"jolt\"), by entrusting to the hand the responsibility of writing as fast as possible what the head itself ignores (this was automatic writing), by accepting the principle and the experience of a collective writing, surrealism helped secularize the image of the Author.", 
    "Finally, outside of literature itself (actually, these distinctions are being superseded), linguistics has just furnished the destruction of the Author with a precious analytic instrument by showing that utterance in its entirety is a void process, which functions perfectly without requiring to be filled by the person of the interlocutors: linguistically, the author is never anything more than the man who writes, just as I is no more than the man who says I: language knows a \"subject,\" not a \"person,\" end this subject, void outside of the very utterance which defines it, suffices to make language \"work,\" that is, to exhaust it.", 
    "The absence of the Author (with Brecht, we might speak here of a real \"alienation:' the Author diminishing like a tiny figure at the far end of the literary stage) is not only a historical fact or an act of writing: it utterly transforms the modern text (or \u2014 what is the same thing \u2014 the text is henceforth written and read so that in it, on every level, the Author absents himself).", 
    "Time, first of all, is no longer the same.", 
    "The Author, when we believe in him, is always conceived as the past of his own book: the book and the author take their places of their own accord on the same line, cast as a before and an after: the Author is supposed to feed the book \u2014 that is, he pre-exists it, thinks, suffers, lives for it;", 
    "he maintains with his work the same relation of antecedence a father maintains with his child.", 
    "Quite the contrary, the modern writer (scriptor) is born simultaneously with his text;", 
    "he is in no way supplied with a being which precedes or transcends his writing, he is in no way the subject of which his book is the predicate;", 
    "there is no other time than that of the utterance, and every text is eternally written here and now.", 
    "This is because (or: it follows that) to write can no longer designate an operation of recording, of observing, of representing, of \"painting\" (as the Classic writers put it), but rather what the linguisticians, following the vocabulary of the Oxford school, call a performative, a rare verbal form (exclusively given to the first person and to the present), in which utterance has no other content than the act by which it is uttered: something like the / Command of kings or the I Sing of the early bards;", 
    "the modern writer, having buried the Author, can therefore no longer believe, according to the \"pathos\" of his predecessors, that his hand is too slow for his thought or his passion, and that in consequence, making a law out of necessity, he must accentuate this gap and endlessly \"elaborate\" his form;", 
    "for him, on the contrary, his hand, detached from any voice, borne by a pure gesture of inscription (and not of expression), traces a field without origin \u2014 or which, at least, has no other origin than language itself, that is, the very thing which ceaselessly questions any origin.", 
    "We know that a text does not consist of a line of words, releasing a single \"theological\" meaning (the \"message\" of the AuthorGod), but is a space of many dimensions, in which are wedded and contested various kinds of writing, no one of which is original: the text is a tissue of citations, resulting from the thousand sources of culture.", 
    "Like Bouvard and Pecuchet, those eternal copyists, both sublime and comical and whose profound absurdity precisely designates the truth of writing, the writer can only imitate a gesture forever anterior, never original;", 
    "his only power is to combine the different kinds of writing, to oppose some by others, so as never to sustain himself by just one of them;", 
    "if he wants to express himself, at least he should know that the internal \"thing\" he claims to \"translate\" is itself only a readymade dictionary whose words can be explained (defined) only by other words, and so on ad infinitum: an experience which occurred in an exemplary fashion to the young De Quincey, so gifted in Greek that in order to translate into that dead language certain absolutely modern ideas and images, Baudelaire tells us, \"he created for it a standing dictionary much more complex and extensive than the one which results from the vulgar patience of purely literary themes\" (Paradis Artificiels).", 
    "succeeding the Author, the writer no longer contains within himself passions, humors, sentiments, impressions, but that enormous dictionary, from which he derives a writing which can know no end or halt: life can only imitate the book, and the book itself is only a tissue of signs, a lost, infinitely remote imitation.", 
    "Once the Author is gone, the claim to \"decipher\" a text becomes quite useless.", 
    "To give an Author to a text is to impose upon that text a stop clause, to furnish it with a final signification, to close the writing.", 
    "This conception perfectly suits criticism, which can then take as its major task the discovery of the Author (or his hypostases: society, history, the psyche, freedom) beneath the work: once the Author is discovered, the text is \"explained:' the critic has conquered;", 
    "hence it is scarcely surprising not only that, historically, the reign of the Author should also have been that of the Critic, but that criticism (even \"new criticism\") should be overthrown along with the Author.", 
    "In a multiple writing, indeed, everything is to be distinguished, but nothing deciphered;", 
    "structure can be followed, \"threaded\" (like a stocking that has run) in all its recurrences and all its stages, but there is no underlying ground;", 
    "the space of the writing is to be traversed, not penetrated: writing ceaselessly posits meaning but always in order to evaporate it: it proceeds to a systematic exemption of meaning.", 
    "Thus literature (it would be better, henceforth, to say writing), by refusing to assign to the text (and to the world as text) a \"secret:' that is, an ultimate meaning, liberates an activity which we might call counter-theological, properly revolutionary, for to refuse to arrest meaning is finally to refuse God and his hypostases, reason, science, the law.", 
    "Let us return to Balzac's sentence: no one (that is, no \"person\") utters it: its source, its voice is not to be located;", 
    "and yet it is perfectly read;", 
    "this is because the true locus of writing is reading.", 
    "Another very specific example can make this understood: recent investigations (J.", 
    "P.", 
    "Vernant) have shed light upon the constitutively ambiguous nature of Greek tragedy, the text of which is woven with words that have double meanings, each character understanding them unilaterally (this perpetual misunderstanding is precisely what is meant by \"the tragic\");", 
    "yet there is someone who understands each word in its duplicity, and understands further, one might say, the very deafness of the characters speaking in front of him: this someone is precisely the reader (or here the spectator).", 
    "In this way is revealed the whole being of writing: a text consists of multiple writings, issuing from 6 several cultures and entering into dialogue with each other, into parody, into contestation;", 
    "but there is one place where this multiplicity is collected, united, and this place is not the author, as we have hitherto said it was, but the reader: the reader is the very space in which are inscribed, without any being lost, all the citations a writing consists of;", 
    "the unity of a text is not in its origin, it is in its destination;", 
    "but this destination can no longer be personal: the reader is a man without history, without biography, without psychology;", 
    "he is only that someone who holds gathered into a single field all the paths of which the text is constituted.", 
    "This is why it is absurd to hear the new writing condemned in the name of a humanism which hypocritically appoints itself the champion of the reader's rights.", 
    "The reader has never been the concern of classical criticism;", 
    "for it, there is no other man in literature but the one who writes.", 
    "We are now beginning to be the dupes no longer of such antiphrases, by which our society proudly champions precisely what it dismisses, ignores, smothers or destroys;", 
    "we know that to restore to writing its future, we must reverse its myth: the birth of the reader must be ransomed by the death of the Author."

    "One of Johnson's oldest and closest friends, Taylor left behind at his death in 1788 some twenty-five sermons which appeared shortly thereafter in two volumes, bearing on their title page the equivocal statement that they had been \"'left for publication by John Taylor.", 
    "' \" Johnson's involvement in the writing of the sermons had long been suspected, and while the details will probably never be known, it now seems likely that it took several forms.", 
    "As James Gray puts it in his study, \"sometimes Johnson composed a whole sermon for his friend;",

    "Taylor did most of the composition, using an occasional Johnsonian turn of phrase.", 
    "\" Johnson's involvement in challenging the authenticity of the Ossian poems - the great prototype of modern literary hoaxes - shows that he continued to collaborate in this way until the very end of his career.", 
    "This episode centered around the epic poems, Fingal (1762) and Temora (1763), which James Macpherson purported to have discovered and translated from the Gaelic of a third-century bard called Ossian.", 
    "In fact, Macpherson had composed most of them himself.", 
    "Despite this - or because of it - their abrupt vigor and haunting suggestiveness struck a chord with the younger generation, especially in Germany, helping to call the Romantic revolution into existence.", 
    "Although not the first to question the poems' authenticity, Johnson became \"the major and most effective spokesman against them.", 
    "\" His contemptuous discounting of them as counterfeits in his Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775) so angered Macpherson that he threatened physical retaliation, causing Johnson to arm himself with a large truncheon.", 
    "This much is well known.", 
    "But Johnson's tendency to efface his participation in collaborative projects operated to conceal the full extent of his involvement in the Ossian affair.", 
    "Only recently has it come to light that Johnson continued the attack on Macpherson, albeit covertly and collaboratively, until the end of his life through his patronage of a young Gaelic scholar by the name of William Shaw.", 
    "Johnson appears to have played at least an advisory role in the composition of the pamphlet in which Shaw first made his own disbelief public, An Enquiry into the Authenticity of the Poems Ascribed to Ossian (1781), for the pamphlet contains numerous complimentary references to Johnson and frequent quotations from his Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland, as well as reverberations of Johnson's charges against Macpherson.", 
    "As battle was joined between Shaw and the poems' proponents, Johnson's participation became more active, although no more public.", 
    "He contributed substantially to penning a rejoinder to the angry response which Shaw's pamphlet almost immediately precipitated.", 
    "This twenty-nine page document, entitled A Reply to Mr.", 
    "Clark, was appended to a new \"corrected \"edition of the Enquiry and published in 1782.", 
    "From the internal stylistic as well as external evidence assembled by Thomas M.", 
    "Curley, it appears that \"Johnson not only supervised [the] entire argumentation \"of the rejoinder, \"but also largely composed half of it and polished portions of the rest.", 
    "\"Although Shaw does not appear to have acknowledged this assistance anywhere, he demonstrated his gratitude by producing the first biography of his silent collaborator, Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Late Dr.", 
    "Samuel Johnson (1785).", 
    "Even as he helped to create the modern myth that genuine authorship consists in individual acts of origination, by orchestrating from behind the scenes this expose of a fraudulent attribution of it, Johnson was himself participating in a mode of writing which puts this notion of authorship in question.", 
    "Space permits mention of but one further example of Johnson's collaborative impulse: his very substantial contribution to the Vinerian law lectures which Robert Chambers delivered at Oxford from 1767 to 1771.", 
    "The Vinerian Chair of English Law had been established in 1758 \"to redress serious deficiencies in contemporary legal training by giving undergraduates a systematic introductory study of their country's laws.", 
    "\" Chambers was the second to hold the chair, having succeeded his teacher William Blackstone, who, during his eight-year tenure, delivered the lectures which formed the basis of his celebrated Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765-1769).", 
    "Less than a fluent writer under the best of circumstances, the erudite Chambers was understandably intimidated at the prospect of following Blackstone - so much so that he postponed the scheduled commencement of his own series of lectures to March 1767.", 
    "During the preceding fall, Johnson came to Chambers's aid, inaugurating a collaboration that would continue at irregular intervals for approximately three more years, and would include several periods during which Johnson was in residence at Oxford.", 
    "Their joint labors yielded fifty-six - later expanded to the mandatory number of sixty - lectures on \"the fundamental concepts, traditions and statutes making up the British constitution.", 
    "\" Although some of Johnson's intimates knew of his participation in the preparation of Chambers's lectures, it was a generally well-kept secret during their lifetimes and beyond.", 
    "Johnson's undisclosed participation certainly went beyond simple encouragement and general supervision.", 
    "The modern editor of the lectures, Thomas M.", 
    "Curley, speculates that Johnson and Chambers must have worked on the lectures, together and apart, in various ways.", 
    "In some instances, he suggests, Chambers wrote independently, while in others \"[t]he collaborators would have pooled the results of their research and exchanged ideas about complex legal issues before Chambers resumed drafting his course and incorporated any argumentation that Johnson may have dictated or written for the professor's use at strategic points.", 
    "\" We do not know whether or not Johnson was paid for his work on Chanbers's lectures.", 
    "But, as in other instances of his self-effacing participation in the composition of works for which others took credit, we may speculate on his non-financial motives.", 
    "From the social dimension of such secret collaborations Johnson found not only good fellowship, social entree, and intellectual stimulation, but also an impetus to literary production - to which he often found it difficult to motivate himself.", 
    "For the arch-author Johnson, the corporate mode of writing appears to have been the most accessible and perhaps the most satisfying.", 
    "In addition, like most of the individuals with whom Johnson shared his words and ideas, Chambers was a close and long-standing friend.", 
    "They had become acquainted in 1754 when Chambers was only seventeen years old.", 
    "Later, Johnson may have been further drawn to the much younger Chambers by \"the promise of legal eminence that he once coveted for himself, the gracious breeding and academic excellence that he always prized, and the filial attachment that he may well have craved in lonely middle age.", 
    "\" Indeed, the preparation of the lectures may have represented a vicarious achievement of goals Johnson was unable to accomplish in his own career.", 
    "Ultimately, his distinctly non-proprietary attitude towards his collaborative contributions may have reflected a real uncertainty as to where his intellect and pervenality left off, and those of his co-writers began.", 
    "It is the chief object of modern textual scholarship to identify in all of this writing those words that originated uniquely with Johnson so that they can be properly credited to him, and a definitive oeurve can be established.", 
    "I do not wish to suggest that there is anything wrong with such activities, only that they presume a proprietary authorial impulse which Johnson apparently did not himself feel.", 
    "Johnson, the author in this modern sense, is Boswell's making.", 
    "\"Without Boswell, \"Alvin Kernan writes, \"Johnson would surely have been an important writer, and an interesting, powerful personality, but probably not the literary type that he is, the towering and highly charged image of the first writer in the industrial, democratic, rationalistic age of print.", 
    "\" Having called attention to the crucial role of Boswell in the making of the modern author, Kernan does not press his advantage, however, and instead of recreating the master wordsmith for us, he falls in with Romantic biographers from Boswell to Bate and evokes the precursor of Wordsworth.", 
    "While \"[m]any writers before Johnson may have, certainly did, write greater books, \"Kernan observes, even the most individualized of them, a Petrarch or a Milton, let alone the anonymous Shakespeare, seem alongside him pale, fading, a few thin lines without much depth, shading, or emotional color.", 
    "His intense personality, in a way the first romantic artist, appears at exactly the right point in literary history in several ways, the kind of poor, strange, troubled person that the print business could attract and use as a Grub Street hack, and, at the same time, the type of individual who needed and could use print to satisfy certain existential needs of his own for bread, for status, for meaning.", 
    "But it went beyond this, and in the end, out of their own needs, Johnson and Boswell together created a social role that transcended individual needs, giving writers an important social function and making books, even in the vast numbers now produced by the printing press, something more than mere information, amusement, and commodity.", 
    "Kernan writes as if the author in the modern sense were the goal toward which history had always been striving.", 
    "But as I have tried to suggest, Johnson's life contains another story - for readers disposed to attend.", 
    "The corporate attitudes which surrounded writing right down through Johnson seem to be reasserting themselves again today.", 
    "In their recent study of professional writing practices, Andrea Lunsford and Lisa Ede have found that most of the writing that goes on today is in fact collaborative.", 
    "Indeed, one comes away from their investigation of how people actually write in business, government, industry, the sciences and social sciences with the impression that there is but one last bastion of solitary origination: the arts and humanities.", 
    "What gives their study such urgency is the fact that, this powerful collaborative trend notwithstanding, the assumption that writing is inherently and necessarily a solitary, individual act still informs both the theory and practice of the teaching of writing.", 
    "Writing is still being taught as if, \"envisioning students' professional lives after graduation, \"composition teachers \"imagine[d] them seated alone, writing in isolation, misplaced Romantic spirits still struggling in a professional garret to express themselves.", 
    "\" In a word, we are not preparing students for the real writing tasks that await them.", 
    "As the collaborative nature of contemporary research and problem-solving fosters multiple authorship in more and more spheres, electronic technology is hastening the demise of the illusion that writing is solitary and originary.", 
    "Even in the still relatively primitive applications that are widely available - the communication networks and information services like Internet, Bitnet, and Compuserve - not to mention the more sophisticated hypertext applications that are just beginning to be developed, the computer is dissolving the boundaries essential to the survival of our modern fiction of the author as the sole creator of unique, original works.", 
    "The dissolution of these boundaries is the subject of Jay David Bolter's recent investigation of the impact of electronic technology on writing.", 
    "In his examination of the on-going discussions that are being conducted in so-called \"newsgroups, \"Bolter notes that [w]hen one subscriber in a newsgroup \"publishes \"a message, it travels to all the dozens or hundreds of others who belong to that group.", 
    "The message may elicit responses, which in turn travel back and forth and spawn further responses.", 
    "The prose of these messages is almost as casual as conversation, precisely because publication in this medium is both easy and almost unrestricted.", 
    "The transition from reader to writer is completely natural.", 
    "The reader of one message can[,] with a few keystrokes[,] send off a reply.", 
    "Readers may even incorporate part of the original message in the reply, blurring the distinction between their own text and the text to which they are responding.", 
    "There is also little respect for the conventions of the prior medium of print.", 
    "Subscribers often type newspaper articles or excerpts from books into their replies without con-cern for copyright.", 
    "The notion of copyright seems faintly absurd, since their messages are copied and relayed automatically hundreds of times in a matter of hours.", 
    "In a variety of ways, electronic communication seems to be assaulting the distinction between mine and thine that the modern authorship construct was designed to enforce.", 
    "Bolter's book is also available on disk, and the electronic \"hypertext \"version differs from the hard copy in several ways which illustrate the point I am making.", 
    "Hypertext consists of text with highlighted words and passages.", 
    "By selecting one of them, the reader accesses a new window which displays an amplification or extension of the highlighted idea.", 
    "This extension, which may be thought of as an extended footnote, albeit one that could as easily be musical or graphic, could itself include highlighted sec-tions which invite the reader to pursue yet further extensions, to explore further tributaries of the main textual stream.", 
    "In short, hypertext liberates the writer (and reader) from the kind of linear exposition that print requires.", 
    "Bolter's electronic book goes off on \"tangents \"which, in the interest of a linear coherence, have had to be omitted from the printed version.", 
    "More significant in the present context, however, is the fact that hypertext can be interactive;", 
    "and when the reader begins actively to intervene in the text, adding to, subtracting from, and modifying it from his or her keyboard, the boundaries between author and reader disintegrate.", 
    "A reviewer of Bolter's book for Artforum writes of how he has already modified his copy of the disk by adding a few notes here and there, with the result that I am now to some degree coauthor of my particular version of the electronic book called Writing Space.", 
    "And when I copy that version and pass it on to my friends (as Bolter specifically invites readers to do), they will no doubt make their own modifications and additions.", 
    "It's conceivable that, after a sufficiently long period, only a small fraction of the material on the disk will have originated from Bolter's keyboard.", 
    "By contributing his or her commentary, the reader becomes an overt collaborator in an unending process of reading and writing which reverses the trajectory of print, returning us to something very like the expressly collaborative writing milieu of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance with which we began.", 
    "Bolter likens this new incarnation of the book to a medieval manuscript the margins of which \"belonged to the scholarly reader \"- were for \"conducting a dialogue with the text.", 
    "\" During generations of copying this text could migrate from the margins into the center, as the glosses of readers made their way into the original text.", 
    "But the Renaissance \"commonplace book \"may provide an even more suggestive analogy.", 
    "These were the notebooks, so to speak, in which one both transcribed writings by others which held some special significance and collected compositions of one's own - usually without a governing plan or arrangement and without attribution.", 
    "Sometimes even the compiler of these \"books \"remained anonymous.", 
    "When names did become associated with individual texts, it was generally for reasons that had nothing to do with authorship in the modern sense.", 
    "As Peter Beal writes, A man's name might become linked with a poem in the course of manuscript transmission because he was the copyist, or because it was written by someone in his circle, or because he added his own stanzas to it, or wrote a reply to it, or set it to music, and so on.", 
    "The compiler of the Renaissance commonplace book composed, transcribed, commented on, and reworked the writings of others - all in apparent indifference to the identity of their originators and without regard for ownership.", 
    "This quintessentially Renaissance form of reading and writing is rapidly being revived by our electronic technology.", 
    "At the outset of the discussion I suggested that one of the most powerful vehicles of the modern authorship construct was provided by the laws which regulate our writing practices.", 
    "Our laws of intellectual property are rooted in the century-long reconceptualization of the creative process which culminated in high Romantic pronouncements like Wordsworth's to the effect that this process ought to be solitary, or individual, and introduce \"a new element into the intellectual universe.", 
    "\"Both Anglo--American \"copyright \"and Continental \"authors' rights \"achieve their modern form in this critical ferment, and today a piece of writing or other creative product may claim legal protection only insofar as it is determined to be a unique, original product of the intellection of a unique individual (or identifiable individuals).", 
    "In short, the law has yet to be affected by the \"critique of authorship \"initiated by Foucault and carried forward in the rich variety of post-structuralist research that has characterized literary studies during the last two decades.", 
    "Indeed, from recent decisions like those examined in Peter Jaszi's contribution to this volume, it would seem that as creative production becomes more corporate, collective, and collaborative, the law invokes the Romantic author all the more insistently.", 
    "There would thus seem to exist both considerable potential and a pressing need to reestablish communication between the two disciplines.", 
    "This is the goal of the present volume."

    "It is well-known to you, so you also know how fruitless it has been.", 
    "It has never broken away from the boring \u2018on the one hand\u2014on the other hand\u2019: on the one hand we should demand that the poet\u2019s work conform to the correct political tendency, on the other hand we have the right to expect that his work be of high quality.", 
    "Naturally this formula is unsatisfactory as long as we do not understand the connection which really exists between the two factors: tendency and quality.", 
    "Of course we can simply decree what this relation is.", 
    "We can say: a work which exhibits the correct political tendency need demonstrate no further qualities.", 
    "We can also decree: a work which exhibits the correct tendency must necessarily exhibit all other qualities.", 
    "The second formulation is not uninteresting.", 
    "What is more, it is correct.", 
    "It is the one I adopt.", 
    "But at the same time I refuse to decree it.", 
    "This assertion must be proven.", 
    "I ask your attention for an attempt at this proof.",

    "Yet you want to advance the study of fascism with such a proof?", 
    "\u2019 That is indeed what I have in mind.", 
    "For I hope to be able to show you that the concept of tendency, in the summary form that it usually occurs in the above-mentioned debate, is a completely inappropriate instrument of political literary criticism.", 
    "I want to show you that the political tendency of a work can only be politically correct if it is also literarily correct.", 
    "That means that the correct political tendency includes a literary tendency.", 
    "For, just to clarify things right away, this literary tendency, which is implicitly or explicitly contained in every correct political tendency\u2014that, and nothing else constitutes the quality of a work.", 
    "The correct political tendency of a work includes its literary quality because it includes its literary tendency.", 
    "I hope I can promise you that this affirmation will shortly become clearer.", 
    "For the moment I would point out that I could have chosen another starting point for my observations.", 
    "I started from the fruitless debate over the relation between a work\u2019s political tendency and its quality.", 
    "I could have started from an older but no less sterile debate: what is the relation between form and content, in political literature in particular?", 
    "This way of formulating the question is decried: rightly so.", 
    "It is considered an academic method of trying to fit literary relations undialectically into compartments.", 
    "Very well.", 
    "But what does the dialectical treatment of the same question look like?", 
    "The dialectical consideration of this question, the one by which I come to the subject itself, can never lead anywhere by starting with isolated and lifeless objects: work, novel, book.", 
    "It must be situated in the living Benjamin uses the word Tendenz throughout to mean the general direction a writer or his work takes, whether political or literary.", 
    "It combines the notions of political line or group with literary school or movement.", 
    "You reply, correctly, that this has been undertaken an innumerable number of times in our friends\u2019 circles.", 
    "Certainly.", 
    "But in so doing, they have often proceeded to generalities right away and thus necessarily became lost in vagaries.", 
    "As we know, social relationships are determined by relationships of production.", 
    "When it examined a work of art, materialist criticism was accustomed to ask how that work stood in relation to the social relationships of production of its time.", 
    "That is an important question.", 
    "But also a very difficult one.", 
    "The answer to it is not always unambiguous.", 
    "Thus I would now like to suggest a question which lies closer at hand.", 
    "A question which is somewhat more modest, which is less encompassing, but which seems to me to have a better chance of being answered.", 
    "Namely, instead of asking: what is the relationship of a work of art to the relationships of production of the time?", 
    "Is it in accord with them, is it reactionary or does it strive to overthrow them, is it revolutionary?", 
    "\u2014in place of this question, or in any case before asking this question, I would like to propose another.", 
    "Before I ask: how does a literary work stand in relation to the relationships of production of a period, I would like to ask: how does it stand in them?", 
    "This question aims directly at the function that the work has within the literary relationships of production of a period.", 
    "In other words, it aims directly at a work\u2019s literary technique.", 
    "With the concept of technique, I have named the concept which gives access to a direct social analysis, and thus a materialist analysis of literary products.", 
    "At the same time the concept of technique gives us the dialectical starting-point from which the sterile opposition between form and content can be overcome.", 
    "The concept of technique also indicates the way to determine correctly the relationships between tendency and quality about which we asked at the beginning.", 
    "So if we could make the above formulation, that the correct political tendency of a work includes its literary quality because it includes its literary tendency, now we can state more exactly that this literary tendency can be found in the progress or regression of literary technique.", 
    "It will certainly be in line with your thinking if I now, only apparently without transition, go on to quite concrete literary problems.", 
    "Russian ones.", 
    "I should like to call your attention to Sergei Tretiakov and to the model of the \u2018operative\u2019 writer which he has defined and embodied.", 
    "This operative writer presents the clearest example of the functional relation which always exists, in any circumstances, between correct Benjamin uses the word Technik to denote ihe aesthetic technique of a work, but with considerable scientific and manufacturing connotations.", 
    "Thus it is also close to \u2018technology\u2019\u2014the technical means by which a work is produced, its means of production.", 
    "Sergei Tretiakov (1892\u20131939?", 
    ") was a famous Soviet playwright and futurist.", 
    "He was a leading participant in the Moscow group which produced the journals Lef and Novy Lef.", 
    "His most important plays, produced in collaboration with Meyerhold and Eisenstein, were Gas Masks (1924).", 
    "Listen Moscow (1924) and Roar China (1930).", 
    "His views on newspapers were published in a collective volume edited by Chuzak in 1929, entitled The Lieterature of Fact, which also included contributions by Brik and Shklovsky.", 
    "Attacking those who demanded \u2018Red Tolstoys\u2019, he wrote: \u2018There is no need for us to wait for Tolstoys, because we have our own epics.", 
    "Our epics are the newspapers.", 
    "\u2019 Tretiakov was purged about 1937.", 
    "The date of his death shortly thereafter is unknown.", 
    "political tendency and a progressive literary technique.", 
    "Of course it is only one example: I am keeping others in reserve.", 
    "Tretiakov distinguishes the operative writer from one who gives information.", 
    "His mission is not to report, but to struggle;", 
    "he does not play the role of spectator, but actively intervenes.", 
    "He defines his task through the statements he makes about his activity.", 
    "At the time of the total collectivization of agriculture, in 1928, when the slogan \u2018writers to the kolkhozy (collective farms)\u2019 was launched, Tretiakov left for the \u2018Communist Lighthouse\u2019 commune and during two lengthy stays there undertook the following tasks: calling mass meetings, collecting money to pay for tractors, persuading individual peasants who worked alone to enter the kolkhoz, inspecting reading rooms, creating wall-newspapers and editing the kolkhoz newspaper, being a reporter for Moscow papers, introducing radio and travelling movies.", 
    "It is not surprising that the novel Master of the fields which Tretiakov wrote after his stay, had a substantial influence on the further formation of agricultural collectives.", 
    "You may appreciate Tretiakov and perhaps still think that his example does not mean very much in this situation.", 
    "The duties he undertook, you may perhaps object, are all those of a journalist or a propagandist: all that doesn\u2019t have very much to do with literature.", 
    "Yet I chose the example of Tretiakov intentionally, to indicate the breadth of the horizon from which we should rethink our notion of literary forms or genres in line with the given techniques of our current situation, so that we may arrive at the forms of expression to which literary energies should be applied today.", 
    "There have not always been novels in the past, they do not always have to exist in the future;", 
    "there have not always been tragedies, not always great epics.", 
    "Commentaries, translations, even so-called forgeries have not always been divertissements on the borders of literature: they have had their place not only in philosophical literature, but in the poetic literatures of Arabia or China.", 
    "Rhetoric has not always been an insignificant form.", 
    "On the contrary, in Antiquity large areas of literature bore its stamp.", 
    "All that should make you conscious of the fact that we stand in the midst of a powerful process of the transformation of literary forms, a process of transformation in which many of the oppositions with which we used to work could lose their power.", 
    "Allow me to give you an example of the sterility of such oppositions and of the process by which they are dialectically overcome.", 
    "That is where we again find Tretiakov.", 
    "The example is, in fact, that of the newspaper.", 
    "\u2018In our literature,\u2019 a leftist author writes, \u2018oppositions which mutually enriched each other in earlier, happier times, have become insoluble antinomies.", 
    "Thus science and belles lettres, criticism and production, culture and politics have fallen away from each other, without maintaining any relationship or order.", 
    "The showplace of this literary confusion is the newspaper.", 
    "Its content is \u201cmaterial\u201d which refuses any form of organization other than that imposed by the reader\u2019s impatience.", 
    "This impatience is not only that of the politician who expects a piece of news, or of a speculator who awaits a tip: behind them hovers the impatience of whoever feels himself excluded, whoever thinks he has a right to express his own interests himself.", 
    "For a long time, the fact that nothing binds the reader to his paper as much as this avid impatience for fresh nourishment every day, has been used by editors, who are always starting new columns open to his questions, opinions, protestations.", 
    "So the indiscriminate assimilation of facts goes hand in hand with the similar indiscriminate assimilation of readers, who see themselves instantly raised to the level of co-workers.", 
    "But this phenomenon hides a dialectical moment: the fall of literature in the bourgeois press reveals the formula for its resuscitation in the Soviet Russian press, because the realm of literature gains in width what it loses in depth.", 
    "In the Soviet press, the difference between author and public, maintained artificially by the bourgeois press, is beginning to disappear.", 
    "The reader is indeed always ready to become a writer, that is to say, someone who describes or even who prescribes.", 
    "As an expert\u2014even if not a professional, but only a job-occupant\u2014he gains entrance to authorship.", 
    "Labour itself speaks out for writing it out in words constitutes part of the knowledge necessary to becoming an author.", 
    "Literary competence is no longer based on specialized training in academic schools, but on technical and commercial training in trade schools and thus becomes common property.", 
    "In a word, it is the literarization of the relationships of life which overcomes otherwise insoluble antinomies and it is the showplace of the unrestrained degradation of the word\u2014that is, the newspaper\u2014which prepares its salvation.", 
    "\u2019 Thus I hope I have shown that the portrayal of the author as a producer must be derived from the press.", 
    "For the press, at least the Russian press, makes us acknowledge that the powerful process of transformation of which I spoke before goes beyond not only the conventional separations between genres, between writer and poet, between the scholar and the popularizer, but it also forces us to re-examine the separation between author and reader.", 
    "The press is the most authoritative instance of this process and therefore any study of the author as a producer must deal with it.", 
    "But we cannot remain at that point.", 
    "For as yet the newspapers of Western Europe are not a suitable instrument of production in the hands of the writer.", 
    "They still belong to capital.", 
    "On the one hand the newspaper, on the technical level, represents the most important literary position.", 
    "But this position is on the other hand in the control of our opponents, so it should not be surprising that the writer\u2019s comprehension of his dependent social position, of his technical possibilities and of his political tasks must struggle against enormous difficulties.", 
    "Among the most important developments in Germany in the last years is the fact that many productive minds have gone through a revolutionary development parallel to and under the pressure of the economic situation, without however, having been able in a revolutionary way to think through their own work and its relationship to the means of production, its productive techniques, its technology.",

    "\u2018The publication of the Versuche\u2019, as the author of that series writes in the introduction, \u2018takes place at a point in time at which certain works should no longer so much relate individual experiences (have the character of a work), but rather should be aimed at the utilization (transformation) of certain institutes or institutions.",

    "In point of fact we are faced with a situation \u2014for which the last decade in Germany furnishes complete proof\u2014in which the bourgeois apparatus of production and publication can assimilate an astonishing number of revolutionary themes, and can even propagate them without seriously placing its own existence or the existence of the class that possesses them into question.", 
    "This is certainly true as long as the apparatus is transmitted by hacks, even if they are revolutionary hacks.",

    "\u2019 Our duty would thus be to transform the concert form in a way which must fulfil two conditions: it must supersede both the opposition between the musicians and the listeners, and that between technical performance and content.", 
    "To this end, Eisler makes the following useful observation: \u2018We must be careful not to over-rate orchestral music and think of it as the only form of high art.", 
    "Music without words took on its great importance and fullest development only with capitalism.", 
    "\u2019 Which means: the duty of transforming the concert is not possible without the aid of words.", 
    "Words alone can, in Eisler\u2019s formulation, bring about the transformation of the concert into a political meeting.", 
    "That such a transformation does, in fact, present a high point of musical and literary technique, Brecht and Eisler have proven with their play The Measures Taken.", 
    "If you now look back at the process of recasting literary forms of which we were speaking, you can see how photography and music (and from these we can judge other forms) will enter a molten stream from which new forms will be cast.", 
    "You see confirmed that only the literarization of all relationships of life can give a correct notion of the extent of this process of recasting, just as the state of the class struggle determines the temperature at which it occurs\u2014in a more or less perfected form.", 
    "I spoke of the operation of a certain type of fashionable photography, which makes misery into a consumer good.", 
    "When I turn to the \u2018new objectivity\u2019 as a literary movement, I must go a step further and say that it has made the struggle against misery into a consumer good.", 
    "In fact, in many cases its political meaning has been exhausted with the transposition of revolutionary reflexes, in so far as they appeared in the bourgeoisie, into objects of distraction and amusement which were integrated without difficulty into the cabaret business of the big cities.", 
    "The metamorphosis of the political struggle from a drive to make a political commitment into an object of contemplative pleasure, from a means of production into an article of consumption, is characteristic of this literature.",

    "The determinant factor is the exemplary character of a production that enables it, first, to lead other producers to this production, and secondly to present them with an improved apparatus for their use.", 
    "And this apparatus is better to the degree that it leads consumers to production, in short that it is capable of making co-workers out of readers or spectators.", 
    "We already possess such a model, about which I can only speak briefly here.", 
    "That is Brecht\u2019s epic theatre.", 
    "People continue to write tragedies and operas which are apparently based on a stage apparatus proven by long experience, whereas in reality they do nothing but transmit an apparatus on the verge of collapse.", 
    "\u2018The prevailing lack of clarity about their situation on the part of musicians, writers and critics,\u2019 Brecht says, \u2018has tremendous consequences, which are not sufficiently stressed.", 
    "For since they think they possess an apparatus which in reality possesses them, they defend an apparatus over which they no longer have any control, which is no longer, as they believe, a means for the producer, but has become a means opposed to the producer.", 
    "\u2019 The theatre\u2019s complicated machinery, enormous expenses for actors, subtle effects, have become a means of opposition to the producers, not least of all because this theatre seeks to recruit the producer for a competition in which film and radio have entangled it and which can lead nowhere.", 
    "This theatre\u2014whether one thinks of the \u2018high-brow\u2019 theatre or that of mere entertainment\u2014 belongs to a satiated social stratum which transforms everything it touches into amusement.", 
    "Its position is hopeless.", 
    "That is not true of a theatre which, instead of entering into competition with the newer instruments of publication and publicity, tries to use them and learn from them, in short, seeks to come to grips with them.", 
    "Epic theatre has chosen to grapple with them.", 
    "Seen from the current level of development of film and radio, it is the modern form of theatre.", 
    "In the interest of this grappling, Brecht went back to the original elements of the theatre.", 
    "He more or less made do with a platform.", 
    "He renounced too far-reaching plots.", 
    "Thus he succeeded in transforming the functional relation between the stage and the public, text and production, director and actor.", 
    "Epic theatre, he explained, should not so much develop an action as present a situation.", 
    "It attains that condition, as we shall soon see, by allowing the action to be broken up.", 
    "Here I would remind you of the songs whose main function is to break the action.", 
    "It is here\u2014namely with the principle of breaking into the action \u2014that the epic theatre takes up a process which, as you can clearly see, has become common in film and radio, press and photography, over the last few years.", 
    "I am speaking of the process of montage: the element which is superimposed breaks into the situation on which it is imposed.", 
    "Allow me to briefly emphasize that this process attains its appropriate, even perhaps its most fully justified form, with epic theatre.", 
    "The interruption of the action, which inspired Brecht to call his theatre \u2018epic\u2019, constantly goes against the public\u2019s theatrical illusion.", 
    "Indeed, such illusion is useless for a theatre which is trying to treat elements of reality as a series of experiments.", 
    "But the situations the epic theatre presents are to be found at the end, not at the beginning of these experiments.", 
    "Situations which, in whatever form, are always ours.", 
    "They are not brought closer to the spectator, but distanced from him.", 
    "He perceives them as real situations, not, as with the naturalist theatre, with self-satisfaction, but with astonishment.", 
    "Thus the epic theatre does not reproduce situations, rather it uncovers them.", 
    "The discovery of situations is accomplished by means of the interruption of the action.", 
    "Only here the interruption does not have the character of fear and pity, but has an organizing function.", 
    "In the midst of the action, it brings it to a stop, and thus obliges the spectator to take a position toward the action, obliges the actor to adopt an attitude toward his role.", 
    "From a single example I want to show you how Brecht\u2019s discovery and development of the notion of the \u2018gesture\u2019 signifies nothing other than a return to the decisive methods of montage in radio and film, but at the same time transforms montage from a process too often dictated by fashion into a human act.", 
    "Imagine a family scene: the woman is just about to grab a bronze statue and throw it at her daughter;", 
    "the father about to open the window and call for help.", 
    "At this very moment a stranger enters.", 
    "The action is interrupted;", 
    "what comes to the foreground in its place is the situation which meets the glance of the stranger: contorted faces, open window, smashed furniture.", 
    "But there is a point of view from which even more common scenes of contemporary existence don\u2019t look very different.", 
    "That is the viewpoint of the epic dramatist.", 
    "To dramatic art as a whole he opposes the dramatic laboratory.", 
    "He seizes in a new way the old and great opportunity of the theatre\u2014 calling into question all that exists.", 
    "At the centre of such an experiment stands man.", 
    "Contemporary man: thus a reduced, a limited man, a man thrown coldly into a cold world.", 
    "But since this is the only man available to us, it is in our interest to know him.", 
    "He undergoes trials, examinations.", 
    "What results is this: the course of events cannot be changed at its peaks, not by heroic virtue and resolution, but only through strictly ordinary habitual actions, through reason and practice.", 
    "To construct what in Aristotelian dramaturgy is called \u2018action\u2019 out of the smallest elements of behaviour, that is the meaning of the epic theatre.", 
    "So its means are more modest than those of the traditional theatre;", 
    "its purposes also.", 
    "It aims less at filling the public with emotion, even if it is that of revolt, than at making it consider thoughtfully, from a distance and over a period of time, the situations in which it lives.", 
    "We can remark in passing that there is no better starting point for thought than laughter.", 
    "In particular, thought usually has a better chance when one is shaken by laughter than when one\u2019s mind is shaken and upset.", 
    "The only extravagance of the epic theatre is its amount of laughter.", 
    "You may have noticed that the chain of thought whose conclusion we are approaching only presents the writer with a single demand, the demand of reflecting, of thinking about his position in the process of production.", 
    "We can be sure of this: this reflection sooner or later leads the writers who are essential, that is, the best technicians of their trade, to conclusions and positions which are the basis of their trustworthy solidarity with the proletariat.",

    "What does it mean to call a graphic designer an author?", 
    "Authorship, in one form or another, has been a popular term in graphic design circles, especially those at the edge of the profession, the design academies and the murky territories that exist between design and art.", 
    "The word authorship has a ring of importance: it connotes seductive ideas of origination and agency.", 
    "But the question of how designers become authors is a difficult one, and exactly who the designer/authors are and what authored design looks like depends entirely on how you define the term and the criteria you choose to grant entrance into the pantheon.", 
    "Authorship may suggest new approaches to understanding design process in a profession traditionally associated more with the communication than the origination of messages.", 
    "But theories of authorship may also serve as legitimizing strategies, and authorial aspirations may actually end up reinforcing certain conservative notions of design production and subjectivity \u2014 ideas that run counter to recent critical attempts to overthrow the perception of design based on individual brilliance.",

    "Since the film director often had little control over the choice of the material \u2014 especially in the Hollywood studio system that assigned directors to projects \u2014 the signature way he treated a varying range of scripts and subjects was especially important in establishing a director's auteur credentials.",

    "To imagine writing as absence seems to be a simple repetition, in transcendental terms, of both the religious principle of inalterable and yet never fulfilled tradition, and the aesthetic principle of the work's survival, its perpetuation beyond the author's death, and its enigmatic excess in relation to him.",

    "First, we need to clarify briefly the problems arising from the use of the author's name.", 
    "What is an author's name?", 
    "How does it function?", 
    "Far from offering a solution, I shall only indicate some of the difficulties that it presents.", 
    "The author's name is a proper name, and therefore it raises the problems common to all proper names.", 
    "(Here I refer to Searle's analyses, among others.", 
    "') Obviously, one cannot turn a proper name into a pure and simple reference.", 
    "It has other than indicative functions: more than an indication, a gesture, a finger pointed at someone, it is the equivalent of a description.", 
    "When one says \"Aristotle,\" one employs a word that is the equivalent of one, or a series, of definite descriptions, such as \"the author of the Analytics,\" \"the founder of ontology,\" and so forth.", 
    "One cannot stop there, however, because a proper name does not have just one signification.", 
    "When we discover that Arthur Rimbaud did not write La Chasse spirituelle, we cannot pretend that the meaning of this proper name, or that of the author, has been altered.", 
    "The proper name and the author's name are situated between the two poles of description and designation: they must have a certain link with what they name, but one that is neither entirely in the mode of designation nor in that of description;", 
    "it must be a specific link.", 
    "However - and it is here that the particular difficulties of the author's name arise - the links between the proper name and the individual named and between the author's name and what it names are not isomorphic and do not function in the same way.", 
    "There are several differences.", 
    "If for example, Pierre Dupont does not have blue eyes, or was not born in Paris, or is not a doctor, the name Pierre Dupont will still always refer to the same person, such things do not modify the link of designation.", 
    "The problems raised by the author's name are much more complex, however.", 
    "If I discover that Shakespeare was not born in the house we visit today, this is a modification that, obviously, will not alter the functioning of the author's name.", 
    "But if we proved that Shakespeare did not write those sonnets which pass for his, that would constitute a significant change and affect the manner in which the author's name functions.", 
    "If we proved that Shakespeare wrote Bacon's Organon by showing that the same author wrote both the works of Bacon and those of Shakespeare, that would be a third type of change that would entirely modify the functioning of the author's name.", 
    "The author's name is not, therefore, just a proper name like the rest.", 
    "Many other facts point out the paradoxical singularity of the author's name.", 
    "To say that Pierre Dupont does not exist is not at all the same as saying that Homer or Hermes Trismegistus did not exist.", 
    "In the first case, it means that no one has the name Pierre Dupont;", 
    "in the second, it means that several people were mixed together under one name, or that the true author had none of the traits traditionally ascribed to the personae of Homer or Hermes.", 
    "To say that X's real name is actually Jacques Durand instead of Pierre Dupont is not the same as saying that Stendhal's name was Henri Beyle.", 
    "One could also question the meaning and functioning of propositions like \"Bourbaki is so-and-so, so-and-so, and so-forth,\" and \"Victor Eremite, Climacus, Anticlimacus, Prater Taciturnus, Constantine Constantius, all of these are Kierkegaard.", 
    "\" These differences may result from the fact that an author's name is not simply an element in a discourse (capable of being either subject or object, of being replaced by a pronoun, and the like);", 
    "it performs a certain role with regard to narrative discourse, assuring a classificatory function.", 
    "Such a name permits one to group together a certain number of texts, define them, differentiate them from and contrast them to others.", 
    "In addition, it establishes a relationship among the texts.", 
    "Hermes Trismegistus did not exist, nor did Hippocrates - in the sense that Balzac existed - but the fact that several texts have been placed under the same name indicates that there has been established among them a relationship of homogeneity, filiation, authentication of some texts by the use of others, reciprocal explication, or concomitant utilization.", 
    "The author's name serves to characterize a certain mode of being of discourse: the fact that the discourse has an author's name, that one can say \"this was written by so-and-so\" or \"so-and-so is its author,\" shows that this discourse is not ordinary everyday speech that merely comes and goes, not something that is immediately consumable.", 
    "On the contrary, it is a speech that must be received in a certain mode and that, in a given culture, must receive a certain status.", 
    "It would seem that the author's name, unlike other proper names, does not pass from the interior of a discourse to the real and exterior individual who produced it;", 
    "instead, the name seems always to be present, marking off the edges of the text, revealing, or at least characterizing, its mode of being.", 
    "The author's name manifests the appearance of a certain discursive set and indicates the status of this discourse within a society and a culture.", 
    "It has no legal status, nor is it located in the fiction of the work;", 
    "rather, it is located in the break that founds a certain discursive construct and its very particular mode of being.",

    "A private letter may well have a signer \u2013 it does not have an author;", 
    "a contract may well have a guarantor \u2013 it does not have an author.",

    "\u00a7 Let us analyze this \"author function\" as we have just described it.", 
    "In our culture, how does one characterize a discourse containing the author function?",

    "If we limit our remarks to the author of a book or a text, we can isolate four different characteristics.", 
    "First of all, discourses are objects of appropriation.", 
    "The form of ownership from which they spring is of a rather particular type, one that has been codified for many years.", 
    "We should note that, historically, this type of ownership has always been subsequent to what one might call penal appropriation.", 
    "Texts, books, and discourses really began to have authors (other than mythical, sacralized and sacralizing figures) to the extent that authors became subject to punishment, that is, to the extent that discourses could be transgressive.", 
    "In our culture (and doubtless in many others), discourse was not originally a product, a thing, a kind of goods;", 
    "it was essentially an act - an act placed in the bipolar field of the sacred and the profane, the licit and the illicit, the religious and the blasphemous.", 
    "Historically, it was a gesture fraught with risks before becoming goods caught up in a circuit of ownership.", 
    "Once a system of ownership for texts came into being, once strict rules concerning author's rights, author-publisher relations, rights of reproduction, and related matters were enacted - at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century - the possibility of transgression attached to the act of writing took on, more and more, the form of an imperative peculiar to literature.", 
    "It is as if the author, beginning with the moment at which he was placed in the system of property that characterizes our society, compensated for the status that he thus acquired by rediscovering the old bipolar field of discourse, systematically practicing transgression and thereby restoring danger to a writing that was now guaranteed the benefits of ownership.", 
    "The author function does not affect all discourses in a universal and constant way, however.", 
    "In our civilization, it has not always been the same types of texts that have required attribution to an author.", 
    "There was a time when the texts we today call \"literary\" (narratives, stories, epics, tragedies, comedies) were accepted, put into circulation, and valorized without any question about the identity of their author, their anonymity caused no difficulties since their ancientness, whether real or imagined, was regarded as a sufficient guarantee of their status.", 
    "On the other hand, those texts we now would call scientific - those dealing with cosmology and the heavens, medicine and illnesses, natural sciences and geography - were accepted in the Middle Ages, and accepted as \"true,\" only when marked with the name of their author.", 
    "\"Hippocrates said,\" \"Pliny recounts,\" were not really formulas of an argument based on authority;", 
    "they were the markers inserted in discourses that were supposed to be received as statements of demonstrated truth.", 
    "A switch takes place in the seventeenth or eighteenth century.", 
    "Scientific discourses began to be received for themselves, in the anonymity of an established or always redemonstrable truth;", 
    "their membership in a systematic ensemble, and not the reference to the individual who produced them, stood as their guarantee.", 
    "The author function faded away, and the inventor's name served only to christen a theorem, proposition, particular effect, property, body, group of elements, or pathological syndrome.", 
    "By the same token, literary discourses came to be accepted only when endowed with the author function.", 
    "We now ask of each poetic or fictional text: From where does it come, who wrote it, when, under what circumstances, or beginning with what design?", 
    "The meaning ascribed to it and the status or value accorded it depend on the manner in which we answer these questions.", 
    "And if a text should be discovered in a state of anonymity \u2013 whether as a consequence of an accident or the author's explicit wish \u2013 the game becomes one of rediscovering the author.", 
    "Since literary anonymity is not tolerable, we can accept it only in the guise of an enigma.", 
    "As a result, the author function today plays an important role in our view of literary works.", 
    "(These are obviously generalizations that would have to be refined insofar as recent critical practice is concerned.", 
    "Criticism began some time ago to treat works according to their genre and type, following the recurrent elements that are enfigured in them, as proper variations around an invariant that is no longer the individual creator.", 
    "Even so, if in mathematics reference to the author is barely anything any longer but a manner of naming theorems or sets of propositions, in biology and medicine the indication of the author and the date of his work playa rather different role.", 
    "It is not simply a manner of indicating the source, but of providing a certain index of \"reality\" in relation to the techniques and objects of experience made use of in a particular period and in such-and-such a laboratory.",

    "\" Critics doubtless try to give this being of reason a realistic status, by discerning, in the individual, a \"deep\" motive, a \"creative\" power, or a \"design,\" the milieu in which writing originates.", 
    "Nevertheless, these aspects of an individual which we designate as making him an author are only a projection, in more or less psychologizing terms, of the operations we force texts to undergo, the connections we make, the traits we establish as pertinent, the continuities we recognize, or the exclusions we practice.", 
    "All these operations vary according to periods and types of discourse.", 
    "We do not-construct a \"philosophical author\" as we do a \"poet,\" just as in the eighteenth century one did not construct a novelist as we do today.", 
    "StilI, we can find through the ages certain constants in the rules of author construction.", 
    "It seems, for example that the manner in which literary criticism once defined the author \u2013 or, rather, constructed the figure of the author beginning with existing texts and discourses \u2013 is directly derived from the manner in which Christian tradition authenticated (or rejected) the texts at its disposal.", 
    "In order to \"rediscover\" an author in a work, modern criticism uses methods similar to those that Christian exegesis employed when trying to prove the value of a text by its author's saintliness.", 
    "In De Viris Mustribus, Saint Jerome explains that homonymy is not sufficient to identify legitimately authors of more than one work: different individuals could have had the same name, or one man could have, illegitimately, borrowed another's patronymic.", 
    "The name as an individual trademark is not enough when one works within a textual tradition.", 
    "How, then, can one attribute several discourses to one and the same author?", 
    "How can one use the author function to determine if one is dealing with one or several individuals?", 
    "Saint Jerome proposes four criteria: (1) if among several books attributed to an author one is inferior to the others, it must be withdrawn from the list of the author's works (the author is therefore defined as a constant level of value);", 
    "(2) the same should be done if certain texts contradict the doctrine expounded in the author's other works (the author is thus defined as a field of conceptual or theoretical coherence);", 
    "(3) one must also exclude works that are written in a different style, containing words and expressions not ordinarily found in the writer's production (the author is here conceived as a stylistic unity);", 
    "(4) finally, passages quoting statements made or mentioning events that occurred after the author's death must be regarded as interpolated texts (the author is here seen as a historical figure at the crossroads of a certain number of events).", 
    "Modern literary criticism, even when \u2013 as is now customary \u2013 it is not concerned with questions of authentication, still defines the author in much the same way: the author provides the basis for explaining not only the presence of certain events in a work, but also their transformations, distortions, and diverse modifications (through his biography, the determination of his individual perspective, the analysis of his social position, and the revelation of his basic design).", 
    "The author is also the principle of a certain unity of writing - all differences having to be resolved, at least in part, by the principles of evolution, maturation, or influence.", 
    "The author also serves to neutralize the contradictions that may emerge in a series of texts: there must be - at a certain level of his thought or desire, of his consciousness or unconscious - a point where contradictions are resolved, where incompatible elements are at last tied together or organized around a fundamental or originating contradiction.", 
    "Finally, the author is a particular source of expression that, in more or less completed forms, is manifested equally well, and with similar validity, in works, sketches, letters, fragments, and so on.", 
    "Clearly, Saint Jerome's four criteria of authenticity (criteria that seem totally insufficient for today's exegetes) do define the four modalities according to which modern criticism brings the author function into play.", 
    "But the author function is not a pure and simple reconstruction made secondhand from a text given as inert material.", 
    "The text always contains a certain number of signs referring to the author.", 
    "These signs, well known to grammarians, are personal pronouns, adverbs of time and place, and verb conjugation.", 
    "Such elements do not play the same role in discourses provided with the author function as in those lacking it.", 
    "In the latter, such \"shifters\" refer to the real speaker and to the spatio-temporal coordinates of his discourse (although certain modifications can occur, as in the operation of relating discourses in the first person).", 
    "In the former, however, their role is more complex and variable.", 
    "Everyone knows that, in a novel offered as a narrator's account, neither the first-person pronoun nor the present indicative refers exactly to the writer or to the moment in which he writes but, rather, to an alter ego whose distance from the author varies, often changing in the course of the work.", 
    "It would be just as wrong to equate the author with the real writer as to equate him with the fictitious speaker;", 
    "the author function is carried out and operates in the scission itself, in this division and this distance.", 
    "One might object that this is a characteristic peculiar to novelistic or poetic discourse, a game in which only \"quasi discourses\" participate.", 
    "In fact, however, all discourses endowed with the author function possess this plurality of self.", 
    "The self that speaks in the preface to a treatise on mathematics - and that indicates the circumstances ofthe treatise's composition identical neither in its position nor in its functioning to self speaks in the course of a demonstration, and that appears the form of \"I conclude\" or \"I suppose.", 
    "\" In the first case, the \"I\" refers to an individual without an equivalent who, in a determined place and time, completed a certain task;", 
    "in the second, the \"I\" indicates an instance and a level of demonstration which any individual could perform provided that he accepted the same system of symbols, play of axioms and set of previous demonstrations.", 
    "We could also, in the same treatise locate a third self;", 
    "one that speaks to tell the work's meaning, the obstacles encountered, the results obtained, and the remaining problems;", 
    "this self is situated in the field of already existing or yet-toappear mathematical discourses.", 
    "The author function is not assumed by the first of these selves at the expense of the other two, which would then be nothing more than a fictitious splitting in two of the first one.", 
    "On the contrary, in these discourses the author function operates so as to effect the dispersion of these three simultaneous selves.", 
    "No doubt, analysis could discover still more characteristic traits of the author function.", 
    "I will limit myself to these four, however, because they seem both the most visible and the most important.", 
    "They can be summarized as follows:(1) the author function is linked to the juridical and institutional system that encompasses, determines, and articulates the universe of discourses;", 
    "(2) it does not affect all discourses in the same way at all times and in all types of civilization;", 
    "(3) it is not defined by the spontaneous attribution of a discourse to its producer but, rather, by a series of specific and complex operations;", 
    "(4) it does not refer purely and simply to a real individual, since it can give rise simultaneously to several selves, to several subjects - positions that can be occupied by different classes of individuals.", 
    "Up to this point I have unjustifiably limited my subject.", 
    "Certainly the author function in painting, music, and other arts should have been discussed;", 
    "but even supposing that we remain within the world of discourse, as I want to do, I seem to have given the term \"author\" much too narrow a meaning.", 
    "I have discussed the author only in the limited sense of a person to whom the production of a text, a book, or a work can be legitimately attributed.", 
    "It is easy to see that in the sphere of discourse one can be the author of much more than a book - one can be the author of a theory, tradition, or discipline in which other books and authors will in their turn find a place.", 
    "These authors are in a position that I will call \"transdiscursive.", 
    "\" This is a recurring phenomenon \u2013 certainly as old as our civilization.", 
    "Homer, Aristotle, and the Church Fathers, as well as the first mathematicians and the originators of the Hippocratic tradition, all played this role.", 
    "Furthermore, in the course of the nineteenth century, there appeared in Europe another, more uncommon, kind of author, whom one should confuse with neither the \"great\" literary authors, nor the authors of religious texts, nor the founders of science.", 
    "In a somewhat arbitrary way we shall call those who belong in this last group \"founders of discursivity.", 
    "\" They are unique in that they are not just the authors of their own works.", 
    "They have produced something else: the possibilities and the rules for the formation of other texts.", 
    "In this sense they are very different, for example, from a novelist, who is, in fact, nothing more than the author of his own text.", 
    "Freud is not just the author of The Interpretation of Dreams or Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious;", 
    "Marx is not just the author of the Communist Manifesto or Das Kapital: they both have established an endless possibility of discourse.", 
    "Obviously, it is easy to object.", 
    "One might say that it is not true that the author of a novel is only the author of his own text;", 
    "in a sense, he also, provided that he acquires some \"importance,\" governs and commands more than that.", 
    "To take a very simple example, one could say that Ann Radcliffe not only wrote The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne and several other novels but also made possible the appearance of the Gothic horror novel at the beginning of the nineteenth century;", 
    "in that respect, her author function exceeds her own work.", 
    "But I think there is an answer to this objection.", 
    "These founders of discursivity (I use Marx and Freud as examples, because I believe them to be both the first and the most important cases) make possible something altogether different from what a novelist makes possible.", 
    "Ann Radcliffe's texts opened the way for a certain number of resemblances and analogies which have their model or principle in her work.", 
    "The latter contains characteristic signs, figures, relationships, and structures that could be reused by others.", 
    "In other words, to say that Ann Radcliffe founded the Gothic horror novel means that in the nineteenth-century Gothic novel one will find, as in Ann Radcliffe's works, the theme of the heroine caught in the trap of her own innocence, the hidden castle, the character of the black, cursed hero devoted to making the world expiate the evil done to him, and all the rest of it.", 
    "On the other hand, when I speak of Marx or Freud as founders of discursivity, I mean that they made possible not only a certain number of analogies but also (and equally important) a certain number of differences.", 
    "They have created a possibility for something other than their discourse, yet something belonging to what they founded.", 
    "To say that Freud founded psychoanalysis does not (simply) mean that we find the concept of the libido or the technique of dream analysis in the works of Karl Abraham, or Melanie Klein;", 
    "it means that Freud made possible a certain number of divergences \u2013 with respect to his own texts, concepts and hypotheses \u2013 that all arise from the psychoanalytic discourse itself.", 
    "This would seem to present a new difficulty, however, or at least a new problem: is the above not true, after all, of any founder of a science, or of any author who has introduced some transformation into a science that might be called fecund?", 
    "After all, Galileo made possible not only those discourses which repeated the laws he had formulated, but also statements very different from what he himself had said.", 
    "If Georges Cuvier is the founder of biology, or Ferdinand de Saussure the founder of linguistics, it is not because they were imitated, nor because people have since taken up again the concept of organism or sign;", 
    "it is because Cuvier made possible, to a certain extent, a theory of evolution diametrically opposed to his own fixism;", 
    "it is because Saussure made possible a generative grammar radically different from his structural analyses.", 
    "Superficially, then, the initiation of discursive practices appears similar to the founding of any scientific endeavor.", 
    "Still, there is a difference, and a notable one.", 
    "In the case of a science, the act that founds it is on an equal footing with its future transformations;", 
    "this act becomes in some respects part of the set of modifications that I makes possible.", 
    "Of course, this belonging can take several forms.", 
    "In the future development of a science, the founding act may appear as little more than a particular instance of a more general phenomenon that unveils itself in the process.", 
    "It can also turn out to be marred by intuition and empirical bias;", 
    "one must then reformulate it, making it the object of a certain number of supplementary theoretical operations that establish it more rigorously, and so on.", 
    "Finally, it can seem to be a hasty generalization that must be retraced.", 
    "In other words, the founding act of a science can always be reintroduced within the machinery of those transformations which derive from it.", 
    "In contrast, the initiation of a discursive practice is heterogeneous to its subsequent transformations.", 
    "To expand a type of discursivity such as psychoanalysis as founded by Freud, is not to give it a form generality it would not have permitted at the outset but, rather, open it up to a certain number of possible applications.", 
    "To limit psy choanalysis as a type of discursivity is, in reality, to try to isolate in the founding act an eventually restricted number of propositions or statements to which, alone, one grants a founding value, and in relation to which certain concepts or theories accepted by Freud might be considered as derived, secondary, and accessory.", 
    "In addition, one does not declare certain propositions in the work of these founders to be false: instead, when trying to seize the act of founding, one sets aside those statements that are not pertinent, either because they are deemed inessential, or because they are considered \"prehistoric\" and derived from another type of discursivity.", 
    "In other words, unlike the founding of a science, the initiation of a discursive practice does not participate in its later transformations.", 
    "As a result, one defines a proposition's theoretical validity in relation to the work of the founders - while, in the case of Galileo and Newton, it is in relation to what physics or cosmology is in its intrinsic structure and normativity that one affirms the validity of any proposition those men may have put forth.", 
    "To phrase it very schematically: the work of initiators of discursivity is not situated in the space that science defines;", 
    "rather, it is the science or the discursivity which refers back to their work as primary coordinates.", 
    "In this way we can understand the inevitable necessity, within these fields of discursivity, for a \"return to the origin.", 
    "\" This return which is part of the discursive field itself, never stops modifying it.", 
    "The return is not a historical supplement that would be added to the discursivity, or merely an ornament;", 
    "on the contrary, it constitutes a effective and necessary task of transforming the discursive practice itself.", 
    "Reexamination of Galileo's text may well change our understanding of the history of mechanics, but it will never be able to change mechanics itself.", 
    "On the other hand, reexamining Freud's texts modifies psychoanalysis itself, just as a reexamination of Marx's would modify Marxism.", 
    "What I have just outlined regarding these \"discursive instaurations\" is, of course, very schematic;", 
    "this is true, in particular, of the opposition I have tried to draw between discursive initiation and scientific founding.", 
    "It is not always easy to distinguish between the two;", 
    "moreover, nothing proves that they are two mutually exclusive procedures.", 
    "I have attempted the distinction for only one reason: to show that the author function, which is complex enough when one tries to situate it at the level of a book or a series of texts that carry a given signature, involves still more determining factors when one tries to analyze it in larger units;", 
    "such as groups of works or entire disciplines.", 
    "\u00a7 To conclude, I would like to review the reasons why I attach a certain importance to what l have said.", 
    "On the one hand, an analysis in the direction that I have outlined might provide for an approach to a typology of discourse.", 
    "It seems to me, at least at first glance, that such a typology cannot be constructed solely from the grammatical features, formal structures, and objects of discourse: more likely, there exist properties or relationships peculiar to discourse (not reducible to the rules of grammar and logic), and one must use these to distinguish the major categories of discourse.", 
    "The relationship (or non-relationship) with an author, and the different forms this relationship takes, constitute \u2013 in a quite visible manner \u2013 one of these discursive properties.", 
    "On the other hand, I believe that one could find here an introduction to the historical analysis of discourse.", 
    "Perhaps it is time to study discourses not only in terms of their expressive value or formal transformations but according to their modes of existence.", 
    "The modes of circulation, valorization, attribution, and appropriation of discourses vary with each culture and are modified within each.", 
    "The manner in which they are articulated according to social relationships can be more readily understood, I believe, in the activity of the author function and in its modifications than in the themes or concepts that discourses set in motion.", 
    "It would seem that one could also, beginning with analyses of this type, reexamine the privileges of the subject.", 
    "I realize that in undertaking the internal and architectonic analysis of a work (be it a literary text, philosophical system, or scientific work), in setting aside biographical and psychological references, one has already called back into question the absolute character and founding role of the subject.", 
    "Still, perhaps one must return to this question, not in order to reestablish the theme of an originating subject but to grasp the subject's points of insertion, modes of functioning, and system of dependencies.", 
    "Doing so means overturning the traditional problem, no longer raising the questions: How can a free subject penetrate the density of things and give it meaning?", 
    "How can it activate the rules of a language from within and thus give rise to the designs that are properly its own?", 
    "Instead, these questions will be raised: How, under what conditions, and in what forms can something like a subject appear in the order of discourse?", 
    "What place can it occupy in each type of discourse, what functions can it assume, and by obeying what rules?", 
    "In short, it is a matter of depriving the subject (or its substitute) of its role as originator, and of analyzing the subject as a variable and complex function of discourse.", 
    "Second, there are reasons dealing with the \"ideological\" status of the author.", 
    "The question then becomes: How can one reduce the great peril, the great danger with which fiction threatens our world?", 
    "The answer is: One can reduce it with the author.", 
    "The author allows a limitation of the cancerous and dangerous proliferation of significations within a world where one is thrifty not only with one's resources and riches but also with one's discourses and their significations.", 
    "The author is the principle of thrift in the proliferation of meaning.", 
    "As a result, we must entirely reverse the traditional idea of the author.", 
    "We are accustomed, as we have seen earlier, to saying that the author is the genial creator of a work in which he deposits, with infinite wealth and generosity, an inexhaustible world of significations.", 
    "We are used to thinking that the author is so different from all other men, and so transcendent with regard to all languages that, as soon as he speaks, meaning begins to proliferate, to proliferate indefinitely.", 
    "The truth is quite the contrary: the author is not an indefinite source of significations that fill a work;", 
    "the author does not precede the works;", 
    "he is a certain functional principle by which, in our culture, one limits, excludes, and chooses;", 
    "in short, by which one impedes the free circulation, the free manipulation, the free composition, decomposition, and recomposition of fiction.", 
    "In fact, if we are accustomed to presenting the author as a genius, as a perpetual surging of invention, it is because, in reality, we make him function in exactly the opposite fashion.", 
    "One can say that the author is an ideological product, since we represent him as the opposite of his historically real function.", 
    "When a historically given function is represented in a figure that inserts it, one has an ideological production.", 
    "The author is therefore the ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we fear the proliferation of meaning.", 
    "In saying this, I seem to call for a form of culture in which fiction would not be limited by the figure of the author.", 
    "It would be pure romanticism, however, to imagine a culture in which the fictive would operate in an absolutely free state, in which fiction would be put at the disposal of everyone and would develop without passing through something like a necessary or constraining figure.", 
    "Although, since the eighteenth century, the author has played the role of the regulator of the fictive;", 
    "a role quite characteristic of our era of industrial and bourgeois society, of individualism and private property, still, given the historical modifications that are taking place, it does not seem necessary that the author function remain constant in form, complexity, and even in existence.", 
    "I think that, as our society changes, at the very moment when it is in the process of changing, the author function will disappear, and in such a manner that fiction and its polysemous texts will once again function according to another mode, but still with a system of constraint \u2013 one that will no longer be the author but will have to be determined or, perhaps, experienced [exp\u00e9rimenter].", 
    "All discourses, whatever their status, form, value, and whatever the treatment to which they will be subjected, would then develop in the anonymity of a murmur.", 
    "We would no longer hear the questions that have been rehashed for so long: Who really spoke?", 
    "Is it really he and not someone else?", 
    "With what authenticity or originality?", 
    "And what part of his deepest sell did he express in his discourse?", 
    "Instead, there would be other questions, like these: What are the modes of existence of this discourse?", 
    "Where has it been used, how can it circulate, and who can appropriate it for himself?", 
    "What are the places in it where there is room for possible subjects?", 
    "Who can assume these various subject functions?", 
    "And behind all these questions, we would hear hardly anything but the stirring of an indifference: What difference does it make who is speaking?"

    "The so-called \u2018death of the Author\u2019, proposed most succinctly by Roland Barthes in a 1968 essay of that name, is closely linked to the birth of critical theory, especially theory based in reader response and interpretation rather than intentionality.",

    "In 1954 film critic and budding film director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut had first promulgated the \u2018politique des auteurs\u2019, a polemical strategy developed to reconfigure a critical theory of the cinema.", 
    "The problem was how to create a theory that imagined a film, necessarily the result of broad collaboration, as the work of a single artist, thus a work of art.", 
    "The solution was to determine a set of criteria that allowed a critic to define certain directors as auteurs.", 
    "In order to establish the film as a work of art, auteur theory held that the director \u2013 hitherto merely one third of the creative troika of director, writer and cinematographer \u2013 had ultimate control over the entire project.", 
    "Auteur theory \u2013 especially as espoused by the American critic Andrew Saris \u2013 speculated that directors must meet three criteria in order to pass into the sacred hall of auteurs.", 
    "Sarris proposed that the director must demonstrate technical expertise, have a stylistic signature that is visible over the course of several films and, through his or her choice of projects and cinematic treatment, show a consistency of vision and interior meaning.", 
    "Since the film director had little control of the material he or she worked with \u2013 especially within the Hollywood studio system, where directors were assigned to projects \u2013 the signature way a range of scripts was treated was especially important.", 
    "The interesting thing about auteur theory is that film theorists, like designers, had to construct the notion of the author as a means of raising what was considered low entertainment to the plateau of fine art.", 
    "The parallels between film direction and design practice are striking.", 
    "Like the film director, the art director or designer is often distanced from his or her material and works collaboratively on it, directing the activity of a number of other creative people.", 
    "In addition, over the course of a career both the film director and the designer work on a number of different projects with varying levels of creative potential.", 
    "As a result, any inner meaning must come from aesthetic treatment as much as from content.", 
    "If we apply the criteria used to identify auteurs to graphic designers, we yield a body of work that may be elevated to auteur status.", 
    "Technical proficiency could be claimed by any number of practitioners, but couple this with a signature style and the field narrows.", 
    "The designers who fulfil these criteria will be familiar to any Eye reader;", 
    "many of them have been featured in the magazine.", 
    "(And, of course, selective republishing of certain work and exclusion of other construct a stylistically consistent oeuvre.", 
    ") The list would probably include Fabian Baron, Tibor Kalman, David Carson, Neville Brody, Edward Fella, Anthon Beeke, Pierre Bernard, Gert Dunbar, Tadanoori Yokoo, Vaughn Oliver, Rick Valincenti, April Greiman, Jan van Toorn, Wolfgang Weingart and many others.", 
    "But great technique and style alone do not an auteur make.", 
    "If we add the requirement of interior meaning, how does this list fare?", 
    "Are there designers who by special treatment and choice of projects approach the issue of deeper meaning in the way Bergman, Hitchcock or Welles does?", 
    "How do you compare a film poster with the film itself?", 
    "The very scale of a cinematic project allows for a sweep of vision not possible in graphic design.", 
    "Therefore graphic auteurs, almost by definition, would have to have produced large established bodies of work in which discernible patterns emerge.", 
    "Who, then, are the graphic auteurs?", 
    "Perhaps Bernard and Van Toorn, possibly Oliver, Beeke and Fella.", 
    "There is a sense of getting a bigger idea, a deeper quality to their work, aided in the case of Bernard and van Toorn by their political affiliations and in Oliver by long association that produces a consistent genre of music, allowing for a range of experimentation.", 
    "In these cases the graphic auteur both seeks projects he is commissioned to work on from a specific, recognisable critical perspective.", 
    "Van Toorn will look at a brief for a corporate annual report from a socio-economic position, Bernard evokes a position of class struggle, capitalist brutality and social dysfunction and Oliver examines dark issues of decay, rapture and the human body.", 
    "Jean Renoir observed that an artistic director spends his whole career remaking variations on the same film.", 
    "Great stylists such as Carson and Baron do not seem to qualify for admission to the auteur pantheon, at least according to Sarris\u2019s criteria, as it is difficult to discern a message in their work that transcends the stylistic elegance of the typography in the case of Baron and the studied inelegance of that of Carson.", 
    "(You have to ask yourself, \u2018What is their work about?", 
    "\u2019) Valicenti and Brody try to inject inner meaning into their work - as in Valicenti\u2019s self published Aids advertising and Brody\u2019s attachment to the post-linguistic alphabet systems - but their output remains impervious to any such intrusion.", 
    "A judgement such as this, however, brings us to the Achilles\u2019 heel of auteur theory.", 
    "In trying to describe interior meaning, Sarris resorts to \u2018the intangible difference between one personality and another\u2019.", 
    "That retreat to intangibility \u2013 the \u2018I can\u2019t say what it is but I know it when I see it\u2019 aspect \u2013 is one of the reasons why the theory has long since fallen into disfavour in film criticism circles.", 
    "It also never dealt adequately with the collaborative nature of cinema and the messy problems of movie-making.", 
    "But while the theory is pass\u00e9, its effect is still with us: the director to this day sits squarely at the centre of our perception of film structure.", 
    "In the same way it could be that we have been applying a modified graphic auteur theory for years without being aware of it.", 
    "After all, what is design theory if not a series of critical elevations and demotions as our attitudes about style, meaning and significance evolve?", 
    "Other models of authorship Auteur theory maybe too limited a model for our current image of design authorship, but there are other ways to frame the issue based on different kinds of practice: the artist\u2019s book, concrete poetry, political activism, publishing, illustration and so on.", 
    "Could a theory of poetics be a functional model?", 
    "Use is a major sticking point in trying to view designed work as poetic: traditionally the poem as artwork is a self-contained artefact, while design refers to some exterior function or overt intention.", 
    "This poetic / practical opposition is resolved in two examples of design production: the artist\u2019s book and activist design.", 
    "The artist\u2019s book offers a form of design authorship from which function has been fully exorcised.", 
    "The artist\u2019s book, in general, is concrete, self-referential and allows for a range of visual experiments without the burden of fulfilling mundane commercial tasks.", 
    "There is a long tradition of artists\u2019 books through the historical avant-garde, the Situationists, Fluxus and experimental publishing in the 1960s and 1970s.", 
    "Its exponents include an eclectic mix of designers and authors (Dieter Rot, Tom Phillips, Warren Lehrer, Tom Ockerse, Johanna Drucker) as well as visual artists (Robert Morris, Barbara Kruger, Mary Kelly, Jenny Holzer, Hans Haacke).", 
    "Dieter Rot has produced a monumental and consistent body of books which explore in a self-reflexive way, the nature of books.", 
    "Lehrer has focused on production processes, such as printing and binding, and aspects of dialogue and narrative.", 
    "He has recently produced a new group of graphic portraits, distributed in the form of trade paperback, perhaps the most recent attempt at wide distribution.", 
    "Artists\u2019 books \u2013 using words, images, structure and material to tell a story or invoke an emotion \u2013 may be the purest form of graphic authorship.", 
    "But the odd thing about the genre is that many of the most skilled designers have avoided it and much of the work produced under the rubrik is of sub-standard graphic quality (not in terms of production values, which are often necessarily low, but in typography and composition).", 
    "The singularity of the artist\u2019s book, the low technical quality and the absence of a practical application may alienate the professional graphic designer.", 
    "If the difference between poetry and practical messages is that the latter are successful only when we correctly infer the intention.", 
    ", then activist design would be labelled as absolutely practical.", 
    "But activist work \u2013 including the work of Gran Fury, Bureau, Woman\u2019s Action Coalition, General Idea, Act-Up, Class Action and Guerilla Girls \u2013 is also self-motivated and self-authored with a clear political agenda.", 
    "Proactive work has a voice and a message, but in its overt intentionality lacks the self-referentiality of the artist\u2019s book Yet several problems cloud the issue of authored activism, not least the question of collaboration.", 
    "Whose voice is speaking?", 
    "Not an individual, but some kind of unified community.", 
    "Is this work open for interpretation or is its point the brutal transmission of a specific message?", 
    "The rise of activist authorship has complicated the whole idea of authorship as a kind of free self-expression.", 
    "Perhaps the graphic author is one that writes and publishes material about design \u2013 Joseph Muller-Brockmann or Rudy VanderLans, Paul Rand or Erik Spiekermann, William Morris or Neville Brody, Robin Kinross or Ellen Lupton.", 
    "The entrepreneurial arm of authorship affords the possibility of a personal voice and wide distribution.", 
    "Most split the activities into three discreet actions: editing, writing and designing.", 
    "Even as their own clients, the design remains the vehicle of the written thought.", 
    "(Kinross, for instance, works as a historian then changes hats and becomes a typographer.", 
    ") Rudy VanderLans is perhaps the purest of the entrepreneurial authors, since in Emigre all three activities blend into a continuous whole.", 
    "In Emigre the content is deeply embedded in the form \u2013 that is, the formal exploration is as much the content of the magazine as the writing.", 
    "VanderLans expresses his message through the selection of the material (as an editor), the content of the writing (as a writer) and the form of the pages and typography (as a form-giver).", 
    "Ellen Lupton and her partner J.", 
    "Abbott Miller have almost single-handedly constructed the new critical approach to graphic design, coupled with an exploratory practice.", 
    "A project such as \u2018The Bathroom, the Kitchen and the Aesthetics of Waste\u2019, an exhibition at the MIT List Visual Arts Centre, seems to approach a new level of graphic authorship.", 
    "The message is expressed equally through graphic / visual devices and text.", 
    "The design of the show evokes the issues that are its content;", 
    "it is clearly self-reflexive.", 
    "(The exhibition catalogue, by contrast, does not embody the same level of graphic authorship.", 
    "Here Lupton seem to have slipped back into the more familiar, functionally separate roles of author and designer.", 
    ") But much of their other work demands to be reckoned with, visually and verbally.", 
    "While Lupton and Miller\u2018\u2019s work is primarily critical \u2013 a reading of exterior social and historical phenomena directed at a specific audience \u2013 the illustrated book, often overlooked by the design community, is almost entirely concerned with the generation of creative narrative.", 
    "Books for children have been one of the most successful outlets, but author / illustrators such as Sue Coe, Art Spiegelmann, Charles Burns, Ben Katchor, Dave McCaulley, Chris van Allesburg, Edward Gorey and Maurice Sendak have also used the book in wholly inventive ways and produced serious work.", 
    "Books such as Speigelmann\u2019s Maus and Coe\u2019s X and Porkopolis expand the form into new areas.", 
    "Other models that may indicate a level of graphic authorship include projects of such a scale that the designer is called on to make sense of a sea of material and construct narrative.", 
    "Bruce Mau\u2019s work with Rem Koolhaas on the gigantic S,M,L,XL, an architectural and typographic \u2018novel\u2019 (see Eye no.", 
    "15 vol.", 
    "4), and Irma Boom\u2019s five-year commission from a powerful Dutch corporation to create a commemorative work of unspecified form, scale and content are two such projects.", 
    "Here the designer \u2013 working like a film director on the unfolding cinematic structure of the work \u2013 assumes a primary position in the shaping of material.", 
    "The final category is that of designers who use the medium of professional graphic design to create self-referential statements and comparisons.", 
    "Examples include April Greiman\u2019s special issue of Design Quarterly, a full-scale image of her pixellated body with a personal text full of dreams and visions, and any number of intricate and enigmatic works by the likes of Tom Bonauro and Allen Hori (for instance, Hori\u2019s graphic interpretation of a Beatrice Warde essay in a recent Mohawk paper promotion).", 
    "Operating in a space between service-orientated projects and free expression, these works eschew the parameters of a client relationship while retaining the forms dictated by the needs of commerce: the book, poster, exhibition and so on.", 
    "In the case of Hori\u2019s visual essay, the client pays for a graphic work to embellish a corporate project and the designer lends his avant-garde credentials to the corporation.", 
    "Forward or backwards?", 
    "If the ways a designer can be an author are complex and confused, the way designers have used the term and the value ascribed to it are equally so.", 
    "Any number of recent statements claim authorship as the panacea to the woes of the brow-beaten designer.", 
    "A recent call for entries for a design exhibition entitled \u2018Designer as Author: Voices and Visions\u2019 sought to identify \u2018graphic designers who are engaged in work that transcends the traditional service-oriented commercial production, and who pursue projects that are personal, social or investigative in nature\u2019 The rejection of the role of the facilitator and call to \u2018transcend\u2019 traditional production imply that the authored design holds some higher, purer purpose.", 
    "The amplification of the personal voice legitimises design as equal to more traditional privileged forms of authorship.", 
    "But if designers should aim for open readings and free textual interpretations \u2013 as a litany of contemporary theorists have convinced us \u2013 that desire is thwarted by oppositional theories of authorship.", 
    "Foucault noted that the figure of the author is not a particularly liberating one: the author as origin, authority and ultimate owner of the text guards against free will of the reader.", 
    "Transferring the authority of the text back over to the author contains and categorises the work, narrowing the possibilities for interpretation.", 
    "The figure of the author reconfirms the traditional idea of the genius creator;", 
    "the status of the creator frames the work and imbues it with mythical value.", 
    "While some claims for authorship may be simply an indication of a renewed sense of responsibility, at times they seem ploys to gain proper rights, attempts to exercise some kind of agency where there has traditionally been none.", 
    "Ultimately the author equals authority.", 
    "While the longing for graphic authorship may be the longing for legitimacy or power, is celebrating the design as central character necessarily a positive move?", 
    "Isn\u2019t that what has fuelled the last 50 years of design history?",

    "It may be that the real challenge is to embrace the multiplicity of methods \u2013 artistic and commercial, individual and collaborative \u2013 that comprises design language.", 
    "An examination of the designer-as-author could help us to rethink process, expand design methods and elaborate our historical frame to incorporate all forms of graphic discourse.",

  "construction.txt": [
    "The findings of this survey study suggest that the construction of author voice by the reader does occur in the reviewing of blind manuscripts for scholarly publication in fields related to writing and applied language studies and that this construction can often be traced to discursive and nondiscursive features of a manuscript\u2014particularly those that deviate, either positively or negatively, from a perceived norm.", 
    "Identifying the features that lead readers to construct author voice in certain ways remains a difficult empirical task, however.", 
    "Given the self-reported nature of this study (and many other previous studies of the blind-review process), the findings are only an approximation of what may be the case.", 
    "Because people process sociolinguistic information such as gender and language differences subconsciously, participants may become aware of their own construction of author identity only on reflection.", 
    "Yet at this point, researchers may need to rely on reviewers\u2019 self-report, which is typical in studies of blind manuscript reviews (including the present study) or conduct detailed qualitative analyses of a relatively small number of participants, as we did in our previous study.", 
    "Because we surveyed specialists in language- and writing-related fields only, we cannot extend our conclusions to reading processes in other fields, particularly the \u201chard\u201d sciences, though this is certainly a worthy area of further research.", 
    "It is possible that our respondents, as specialists in writing and language, paid more attention to the ways in which a text reveals (at least in the reader\u2019s eyes) certain aspects of author identity than a biologist or engineer might.", 
    "It may also be the case that other dimensions of identity\u2014 such as who an author studied with or what epistemological orientation he or she adopts\u2014take on greater importance for readers in other fields of study or for other journals.", 
    "Again, we hope that these questions will be taken up in future studies.", 
    "Though our study suggests that content and rhetorical features are more important than linguistic features in signifying author voice to many reviewers, our findings do corroborate the role that deviation from a perceived norm\u2014 whether it be in relation to topic, disciplinary breadth, or linguistic variety\u2014 can play in constructing author identity.", 
    "Preferred voices within academic writing are, after all, those that display some sort of symbolic capital for the reviewers.", 
    "As Starfield notes, student writers \u201cwhose meanings are already more legitimate, who speak and write the legitimate language, have a greater likelihood of becoming successful\u201d.", 
    "We make no claims here regarding the outcomes of such perceptions of the manuscript reviewers we surveyed, and indeed Flowerdew\u2019s survey study of journal editors found that editors in the same fields we studied often made a special effort to support non-native English writers and felt that their manuscript reviewers were generally also supportive of these writers.", 
    "Nevertheless, reader construction of voice within contexts of assessment and gatekeeping certainly does have the potential to serve as a mechanism for cultural reproduction, with readers favoring texts and writers who uphold established disciplinary norms.", 
    "Findings related specifically to the blind manuscript review process have particular relevance to research into the sociopolitical dynamics of scholarly publication, a line of inquiry that has flourished in recent years.", 
    "Though the focus of many of these studies has been on publication processes and practices of relative novices and of multilingual scholars, issues of author identity are often alluded to, both implicitly and explicitly.", 
    "Non-native English-speaking scholars in Flowerdew\u2019s and Curry and Lillis\u2019s case studies, for instance, expressed concern about the extent to which reviewers perceive them as non-native English writers, saying, \u201cIf the style or the form of the paper is not native or not current, reviewers think that \u2018this is a stupid man, this is not acceptable material\u2019\u201dand \u201cWhat makes me feel bad is I get letters from the reviewer, and in the first two sentences it will say this is definitely not written by a native speaker.", 
    "Similarly, in her study of scholars writing from peripheralized non-English-dominant locations, found that writing style was the most frequent area of comment within manuscript readers\u2019 reviews, and it was nearly always negative for these writers.", 
    "In the present study, Respondent 10\u2019s comment, quoted in the previous section, does seem to substantiate these concerns.", 
    "Beyond the blind manuscript review process, our study has implications for understanding reader construction of author identity in academic writing.", 
    "We have shown that readers tend to form impressions of or actively construct identities for authors, even when the author\u2019s autobiographical identity is erased from a text.", 
    "This same process may occur in other contexts, such as classroom assessment and written placement tests.", 
    "A better understanding of how readers construct voice (and, therefore, authorial identities) has potential benefits for writing teachers and program administrators.", 
    "Our study suggests that such construction is shaped by the rhetorical task (evaluation), the subject position of the reader (reviewer, gatekeeper), and the reader\u2019s own values (disciplinary, epistemological, style, etc.", 
    ") This study also highlights the need for a theoretical distinction between the identities that writers hope to project and the identities that readers assign.",

    "That these changes are as hard to grapple with as they are might be seen in the slightly bumpy path that this particular manifestation of my argument \u2013 this article, in Culture Machine \u2013 took in coming to fruition.", 
    "When I was originally contacted by the journal editors, who sounded as though they were interested in republishing some part of the work I\u2019d done in my online book manuscript, Planned Obsolescence, I took them somewhat literally.", 
    "It\u2019s a model we all understand: you publish something somewhere, and then sometimes, if you\u2019re lucky, it gets reprinted somewhere else, in whole or in part.", 
    "What I somewhat densely missed is the difference that the Internet makes in such a process.", 
    "In print, reprinting makes sense: an article appears in a journal and then re-appears in an anthology, or perhaps in a single-author book expanding on the argument.", 
    "The different context of the reprinted article allows it to reach different audiences, to accomplish different tasks, than the original text has done.", 
    "On the Internet, however, such literal reprinting makes far less sense;", 
    "if the editors of Culture Machine wanted their audience to read my text as previously published, why wouldn\u2019t they simply link to it?", 
    "The seamlessness of the Internet makes nearly all texts available as part of the same vast (if at times poorly edited) anthology;", 
    "despite the common practice of cross-posting blog entries on multiple sites, reprinting is no longer strictly speaking necessary.", 
    "What digital publishing facilitates, however, is a kind of repurposing of published material that extends beyond mere reprinting.", 
    "The ability of an author to return to previously published work, to rework it, to think through it anew, is one of the gifts of digital text\u2019s malleability \u2013 but our ability to accept and make good use of such a gift will require us to shake many of the preconceptions that we carry over from print.", 
    "In this case, the networked venues in which this article and its predecessor chapter appear have afforded me the opportunity to focus in on the relationship between my own assumptions about originality and the kinds of reworking that the digital facilitates.", 
    "Originality, however, especially in its relationship to productivity, is deeply ingrained within our scholarly values, and the process of breaking down those assumptions, of changing those values, will no doubt be an anxious one for many of us.", 
    "But of course many of us live with a host of anxieties about writing already, anxieties that can interfere with our work and yet make it difficult to change the ways that we approach that work.", 
    "These anxieties have deep roots, being embedded not just in the complexities of academic life (such as the often painful changes in focus required to move from teaching through committee meetings and into writing), and not just in the enormous weight placed upon the quantified outcomes of our writing within academic systems of reward, but in the very nature of authorship as we have constructed it in western culture.", 
    "This is the reason that so many academic selfhelp books focused on issues around writing have been published: from Academic Writing for Graduate Students to Writing Your Dissertation in Fifteen Minutes a Day (Bolker, 1998), from Bill Germano\u2019s From Dissertation to Book (2005) to his Getting It Published (2001), and from Beth Luey\u2019s Handbook for Academic Authors (2002) to Robert Boice\u2019s Professors as Writers (1990) to Paul Silvia\u2019s on-the-nose How to Write a Lot (2007), just to name a few.", 
    "The existence of such an enormous selection of guides to the academic writing process suggests both that many of us are in substantive need of advice and assistance in our writing lives and that we\u2019re not getting that advice and assistance elsewhere, whether in grad school or beyond.", 
    "It also suggests that we believe that someone out there knows how to be a successful author, and that if they could just put their process into words, words that could be transmitted clearly enough, we could put them into practice.", 
    "In what follows, I argue that we all need \u2014 myself not least among us \u2014 to rethink our authorship practices and our relationships to ourselves and our colleagues as authors, not only because the new digital technologies becoming dominant within the academy are rapidly facilitating new ways of working and new ways of imagining ourselves as we work, but also because such reconsidered writing practices might help many of us find more pleasure, and less anxiety, in the act of writing itself.", 
    "This is of course not to suggest that digital publishing networks will miraculously solve all of the difficulties that we face as writers;", 
    "rather, it is to say that network technologies might help us feel less alone and less lost in the writing process.", 
    "But such change will require taking the time to question our assumptions about authorship and how they impose themselves on our writing lives.", 
    "In my exchange with the Culture Machine editors, I\u2019ve found the opportunity to think about how digital publishing might encourage authors to rework previously published material, and how, in returning to a text that seemed complete, we might find new modes of engagement with our ideas and our audiences.", 
    "It may seem odd to suggest that we need to spend some time rethinking the nature of authorship, as it certainly looks as though, at least in literary fields, we\u2019ve done little other than that for the last four decades or so.",

    "However critically aware we may be of the historical linkages among the rise of capitalism, the dominance of individualism, and the conventionally understood figure of the author, our own authorship practices have remained subsumed within those institutional and ideological frameworks.", 
    "If anything, questioning those frameworks seems to have added to our anxieties about our own writing;", 
    "Ede and Lunsford (2001) point out that, \u2018however we theorize the subject and author, problems of writing and of scholarly (and pedagogical) practice decidedly remain.", 
    "Amid such intense questioning, a kind of paralysis seems possible\u2019.", 
    "Little wonder, then, that we prefer to leave such notions in theory: \u2018We scholars in English studies, it appears, are often more comfortable theorizing about subjectivity, agency, and authorship than we are attempting to enact alternatives to conventional assumptions and practices\u2019.", 
    "Examining those structures closely, with the intent of making any kind of practical change, will no doubt be uncomfortable for many of us.", 
    "Academic authorship as we understand it today has evolved in conjunction with our publishing and employment practices, and changing one aspect of the way we work of necessity implies change across the entirety of the way we work \u2014 an unnerving thought, indeed.", 
    "As I\u2019ve argued across my recent work, though, it\u2019s possible that all of these practices would benefit from certain kinds of change: some of our publishing practices are economically unsustainable, some of our employment practices are out of step with our actual intellectual values, and some of our writing practices are more productive of anxiety than they are of good work.", 
    "Digital scholarly publishing itself cannot solve these problems;", 
    "none of them has an easy technological fix.", 
    "However, adopting new technologies will require us to face these problems;",

    "We must examine our values, and the ways that our new technologies may affect them, in order to make the most productive use of those new forms.", 
    "Having said that, this has now become a point at which I need to perform the ritual of forswearing technological determinism;", 
    "I\u2019m not arguing that the technologies with which we work determine social, intellectual, or institutional structures within which we use them.", 
    "Computers do not make us think differently.", 
    "At the same time, however, I would not argue that they have no effect on the world in which they operate, or that their development is ultimately determined by cultural constraints;", 
    "clearly computers, like all of our other technologies, have had certain effects on our lives, some intended, and some unintended.", 
    "Rather than asserting either an obviously flawed technological determinism or an equally flawed anti-determinism, what I\u2019m suggesting is that technologies and cultures are mutually determining, and thus must evolve in concert.", 
    "As Jay David Bolter has argued, \u2018Technological constraints and social construction always interact in such a way that it is impossible to separate the two\u2019 (Bolter, 1996: 254).", 
    "Social and institutional structures develop new technologies to serve their purposes, but the design of those technologies can have effects that are often unforeseen.", 
    "The example of the word processor might be relevant here.", 
    "In the not too very distant past, many professors had secretaries, or perhaps typists, or at the very least wives, who handled a key aspect of the production of their work.", 
    "Over the last three decades, a series of technological and social changes has made such a phenomenon all but unheard of;", 
    "with very few exceptions, everybody operates his (or her!", 
    ") own word processor, manages his own email, writes his own memos, and so forth.", 
    "Such changes have of course taken hold in any number of professions, but the impact for scholars on the writing process has been significant.", 
    "Typing has ceased to be a technological process that follows the intellectual act of writing, which thus allowed it to be outsourced, and has instead become the core of the writing process itself.", 
    "This change has in turn had dramatic effects on the ways we write.", 
    "The chapter on which this article draws, for instance, was originally composed in the kind of fits and starts that would have been all but impossible if I\u2019d been tied to a typewriter;", 
    "first, I put together a very spotty outline, and then fleshed that outline out, moving and changing sections as the logic of the argument began to unfold.", 
    "I then gradually transformed that outline into ugly, hacky prose, and then into a more polished, more readable draft.", 
    "And all of this took place within the same document, within the same window on my laptop screen.", 
    "Things got moved around, deleted, inserted, revised;", 
    "I jumped between sections as various thoughts occurred to me;", 
    "I began sentences having no idea where they would end;", 
    "I trashed entire concepts in mid-stream.", 
    "And in transforming the chapter into this article, I duplicated the document and began my revisions from that point.", 
    "None of this would have been possible \u2014 or, where possible, it certainly would have been much less pleasant \u2014 back in the days when I wrote my term papers in longhand on legal pads before laboriously typing up the final draft.", 
    "The word processor has allowed my writing to become much more about process \u2014 more recursive, more nonlinear, more open-ended, more spontaneous \u2014 than previous technologies permitted.", 
    "Even more to the point, the technologies that support Internetbased writing and communication developed in a milieu \u2014 among scientific researchers \u2014 in which a higher value was placed on the sharing of information than on the individual authorship or ownership of particular texts.", 
    "From Vint Cerf\u2019s development of the \u2018transmission control protocol\u2019 at the heart of TCP/IP, to Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s creation of the World Wide Web, to Marc Andreesen\u2019s invention of the graphical web browser, the Internet\u2019s technologies have been designed to promote the open exchange of data in a content-agnostic fashion.", 
    "As Lawrence Lessig explains in The Future of Ideas (2001), the \u2018end-to-end\u2019 design of the networks that make up the Internet produce its neutrality;", 
    "the network treats any packet of data just like any other, leaving it to the applications located at the network\u2019s ends to determine how such data should be interpreted.", 
    "Similarly, in the design of the HTTP and HTML protocols that make the web possible, Berners-Lee privileged an ideal of open communication based upon the interconnectability of all documents on the network, regardless of their location, and he gave those protocols away for free, enabling others to build upon them.", 
    "And every major web browser since the beginning has allowed users to view any page\u2019s source code, encouraging the sharing of new technologies and designs.", 
    "Since those early days of its development, of course, the web has changed enormously, including an increase in technologies for the regulation and restriction of certain kinds of communication, but the values of open, shared protocols and codes that encouraged the web\u2019s development still linger in its culture.", 
    "And just as many longestablished industries \u2014 the music business most famously, but only because they were hit first \u2014 are being forced to reinvent the ways that they do business in the wake of the model established by a small group of theoretical physicists, so many of us in the academy would benefit from taking a long, hard look at the ways that we work, and from trying to imagine the ways that current and future technological developments might continue to affect the ways that we write.", 
    "In fact, some of these effects may be even more significant than those enabled by the word processor, precisely because of the networked structures of the newer technologies, and the kinds of interconnections and interactions that they make possible.", 
    "Writing and publishing in networked environments might require a fundamental change not just in the tools with which we work, or in the ways that we interact with our tools, but in our senses of our selves as we do that work, and in the institutional understandings of the relationships between scholars and their now apparently independent silos of production.", 
    "As Carla Hesse wrote in 1996, in an examination of the historical development of the culture surrounding the book, The striking parallels between the late eighteenth and late twentieth centuries\u2019 cultural debates suggest to me that what we are witnessing in the remaking of the \u2018modern literary system\u2019 at the end of the twentieth century is not so much a technological revolution (which has already occurred) but the public reinvention of intellectual community in its wake.", 
    "(Hesse, 1996: 29) The technologies of a new literary system, in other words, are here;", 
    "they\u2019ve taken root, and are quickly becoming dominant, both in the culture at large and in the academy in particular.", 
    "What we need to consider, in this sense, is less whether we ought to change our tools but what shifts and reinventions in our intellectual lives the changes already underway will require of us.", 
    "I want to suggest, however, that such shifts are not, in actuality, radical alterations of the nature of authorship, but rather an acknowledgment and intensification of things that have been going on beneath the surface all along.", 
    "In that sense, my aim is less to disrupt all our conventional notions of authorship than to demonstrate why thinking about authorship from a different perspective \u2014 one that\u2019s always been embedded, if dormant, in many of our authorship practices \u2014 could result in a more productive, and hopefully less anxious, relationship to our work.", 
    "This relationship will be more productive both because we\u2019ll have the opportunity to re-center our understanding of what we\u2019re doing when we\u2019re writing, and what others are doing when they\u2019re reading what we\u2019ve written, within the framework of an ongoing conversation, a process of communication amongst peers that can be promoted and supported by the technologies of the Internet.", 
    "Such a return to communication, to interconnection, as the focus of our writing practices will furthermore enable academic authors to think about the ways that open technologies might lead us to open our texts \u2014 to understand them as always potentially in process, and always in conversation with other texts and authors.", 
    "Such open texts will have the potential to address multiple audiences, in multiple forms, allowing for the possibility of a renewed dialogue between the academy and the surrounding social sphere.", 
    "In all of this, the key issue is interaction.", 
    "The author is not operating \u2014 and has never operated \u2014 in a vacuum, but has always been a participant in an ongoing conversation.", 
    "Some aspects of the interactions made possible by new network technologies may seem daunting or alarming to us today, but in the long run, used with care, they\u2019ll provide significant possibilities for the kind of advancement of knowledge that we all seek, an advancement that requires a broad communal framework.", 
    "Earlier thinking about the intersection between authorship and computer technologies often overlooked this communal framework, in part because such examinations were focused on standalone computers running discrete hypertexts.", 
    "Howard Bloch and Carla Hesse argued, for instance, in the introduction to \u2018Future Libraries,\u2019 the Spring 1993 special issue of Representations: The potential loss of the object book, the disappearance of the author and reader as coherent imagined selves constituted through the stabilizing form of the bound book, the disordering of authorial agency in favor of an increasingly active reader (or alternatively, the empowerment of the \u2018online\u2019 author in control of the uses and distribution of texts), the displacement of a hermeneutical model of reading by one premised on absorption, the transformation of copyright into contract: all point toward the subsuming fear of a loss of community.", 
    "I want to suggest, however, that while these senses of loss are indeed linked, the dominant fear toward which they point in the age of \u2018Web 2.", 
    "0\u2019 may not, in fact, be the fear of loss of community, but the fear of loss of individuality, the assumption that \u2018coherent imagined selves\u2019 require separation rather than interconnection to be thought coherent, and that the \u2018disordering of authorial agency in favor of an increasingly active reader\u2019 is a disruption of authority inasmuch as a changing relationship.", 
    "If academic writing is to move productively into a digital environment, and if, as Mark Poster has argued, \u2018the shift in the scene of writing from paper and pen or typewriter to the globally networked computer is a move that elicits a rearticulation of the author from the center of the text to its margins, from the source of meaning to an offering, a point in a sequence of a continuously transformed matrix of signification\u2019 then we must stop to consider where, in the age of the Internet, authority lies.", 
    "From product to process While there are several key changes in the forms that authority takes online that are worth exploring, I want to focus here on a coming shift in the status of the texts that we produce when we write, including their very shape and structure.", 
    "We are all attuned to the form of the book review, the essay, the article, the book, but digital publishing has thus far produced a number of new forms, none of which comfortably fit in our old structures.", 
    "The blog, for instance, is arguably the first successful web-native electronic publishing platform, one with a number of structural elements that cannot be replicated in print, and one that therefore encodes different expectations than do print texts.", 
    "Blogging developed quickly from a mildly peculiar and somewhat self-regarding web-publishing practice limited to a small sector of the techno-elite into a surprisingly widespread phenomenon, thanks in part to a number of free software packages and services that made blogging no more difficult than writing itself.", 
    "Blogger, the first of those tools, was released in October 2000;", 
    "by July 2008, Technorati.", 
    "com was tracking the activity on 112.", 
    "8 million blogs.", 
    "Among those blogs, the type and level of discourse vary greatly: some blogs are exclusively personal journals, while others are focused on politics or other aspects of the public sphere, and many are in fact a blend of the two;", 
    "some blogs are single-authored while others are the works of groups;", 
    "some blogs exclusively publish text while many others include other forms of media.", 
    "And, of course, some blogs are \u2018good,\u2019 while others aren\u2019t.", 
    "None of this variation should distract us from the key point: the rapid spread of blogs and the relative robustness of their platforms should suggest that their tools might be useful to a range of potential, specialized digital publishing modes.", 
    "Among these tools, that most commonly associated with blogs is the ability of readers to comment on entries, creating multi-vocal and wide-ranging conversations;", 
    "another such tool is the link, whether standard HTML links created within blog entries in order to comment on other web-based texts or the links automatically generated and transmitted by blogging engines in order to leave an indication on a linked-to text that it has been commented upon elsewhere (known as \u2018trackbacks\u2019 or \u2018pingbacks\u2019).", 
    "There\u2019s an oftenunremarked third feature provided by some blog engines, as well as by other web publishing platforms such as wikis, which might even more powerfully affect our thinking about the life of scholarly writing online: versioning.", 
    "All three of these features \u2014 commenting, linking, and versioning \u2014 produce texts that are no longer discrete or static, but that live and develop as part of a network of other such texts, among which ideas flow.", 
    "Of these features, however, versioning may in some ways be the most disconcerting for traditional authors, including academics, whose work lives have been organized not around writing as an ongoing action but rather writing as an act of completing discrete projects.", 
    "In part this emphasis on the completeness and stability of written texts developed in conjunction with the ideas about originality subtending the modern author;", 
    "one of the assumptions that the technologies, implementations, and organizations surrounding print publishing have produced is that any text that comes into our hands, whether a book or a journal, is present in its entirety and will be consistent from copy to copy.", 
    "We further assume that any changes made to the text in further printings will be corrections or emendations meant to bring the printed text into line with the author\u2019s or publisher\u2019s intentions;", 
    "changes more substantive than these, we assume, will be revisions of a sort labeled by the publisher as a \u2018second\u2019 or \u2018revised\u2019 edition.", 
    "We rely on such stability as a sign of a text\u2019s authority, and where it doesn\u2019t exist, the resulting oddities often become themselves the object of scholarly investigation.", 
    "There\u2019s another factor, however, one perhaps peculiar to academic authorship, that puts additional pressure on completion as the most significant moment in the writing process.", 
    "Only at the point of completion, after all, can our projects at last attain their final purpose: the entry of a new item on the CV.", 
    "This emphasis on the academic version of the bottom line \u2014 evidence of scholarly \u2018productivity\u2019 that must be demonstrated in order to obtain and maintain a professorial appointment \u2014 brings a distinctly Fordist, functionalist mode of thinking to bear on our work as writers.", 
    "Bill Readings, in The University in Ruins (1996), calls attention to the ways that the metaphor of \u2018production\u2019 in scholarly life transforms the university into \u2018a bureaucratic apparatus for the production, distribution, and consumption of knowledge\u2019, whose purpose rapidly degenerates from the knowledge that is produced to the fact of production itself: \u2018Produce what knowledge you like, only produce more of it, so that the system can speculate on knowledge differentials, can profit from the accumulation of intellectual capital\u2019.", 
    "Such functionalism, however, cannot become so endemic to our institutions without being reflected in our individual approaches to the work we do as members of them.", 
    "Lindsay Waters links the emphasis on scholarly productivity to the crisis in academic publishing, arguing that \u2018there is a causal connection between the corporatist demand for increased productivity and the draining of publication of any significance other than as a number\u2019.", 
    "Writing has, in Waters\u2019s view, been reduced from a process of discovery and exploration, a process of communication, to a system for the assembly of more and more new products.", 
    "If this is the case, and if the result is, as Waters claims, that many scholars feel \u2018more and more like the figure portrayed by Charlie Chaplin in the film Modern Times, madly and insensibly working to produce\u2019, it is little wonder that many of us experience unresolved anxieties about our writing.", 
    "As long as we are in the process of writing, we have not yet completed it, and without completion, we cannot get credit for what we have produced;", 
    "we haven\u2019t accomplished anything.", 
    "We must put a close to our texts, put them into print, and walk away, not least in order to move onto the next project.", 
    "But being \u2018done\u2019 with a project published online runs to some extent counter to the network\u2019s open-endedness.", 
    "What made blogs so immediately popular, both with readers and with writers, was the very fact that they changed and developed over time, existing not as a static, complete text but rather as an ongoing series of updates, additions, and revisions.", 
    "This is of course to be expected of a journal-like format, and might easily be compared to any form of periodical or serial publication;", 
    "the blog as a whole remains relatively constant, even as new \u2018issues\u2019 or posts are added to it.", 
    "But the fact that a blog\u2019s readers return again and again in order to find those new posts might encourage us to ask whether there is something in the structure of digital authorship that privileges and encourages development and change, even beyond the obviously diachronic aspect of the blog\u2019s structure.", 
    "When web pages are not regularly updated and attended to, after all, they\u2019re subject to rapid degeneration: aging styles, outdated standards, and worst, perhaps, \u2018link rot.", 
    "\u2019 Such ephemerality makes it arguable that the unspoken contract between the author and the reader of a piece of digital text is radically different from that between the author of a book and its reader;", 
    "rather than assuming that the text is fixed, complete, and stable, the reader of a digital text may well assume otherwise.", 
    "As Clifford Lynch suggests, we do not yet fully understand what \u2018reader expectations about updating published work\u2019 will the assumption come to be that a text must be up-to-date, with all known errors corrected, reflecting new information as it comes to light, in order to maintain the \u2018authority\u2019 that print has held?", 
    "Sites such as Wikipedia seem to indicate a growing assumption that digitally published texts not only will but should change over time.", 
    "Digital text is, above all else, malleable, and the relationship between the reader and the text reflects that malleability;", 
    "there is little sense in attempting to replicate the permanence of print in a medium whose chief value is change.", 
    "On the other hand, allowing a text to grow and change over time shouldn\u2019t \u2014 and needn\u2019t \u2014 efface earlier incarnations of a text by simply overwriting them with newer versions.", 
    "Versioning preserves the history of a text, allowing it to live and breathe while maintaining snapshots of the text at key moments, as well as the ability to compare those snapshots, permitting readers to approach a text not just in a finished state, but throughout its process of development.", 
    "That ability to focus on process may well lead to new modes of criticism;", 
    "as Carla Hesse suggested in the mid-1990s, well before any but the very first blogs had been established, What appears to be emerging from the digital revolution is the possibility of a new mode of temporality for public communication, one in which public exchange through the written word can occur without deferral, in a continuously immediate present.", 
    "A world in which we are all, through electronic writing, continuously present to one another.", 
    "There is, I would like to suggest, something unprecedented in this possibility of the escape of writing from fixity.", 
    "What the digitalization of text seems to have opened up is the possibility for writing to operate in a temporal mode hitherto exclusively possible for speech, as parole rather than langue.", 
    "This \u2018continuously immediate present\u2019 of writing could allow our writing projects, and our conversations around those projects, to develop in a more fruitful, more organic fashion.", 
    "But this will require a fairly radical shift in our understandings of what it is we\u2019re doing as we\u2019re writing, because if our texts are going to continue to grow even as they\u2019re published online, we\u2019re going to need to be present in those texts in order to shepherd that growth \u2014 perhaps not forever, but certainly for longer than we have been with traditional print publishing.", 
    "This thought will make many of us nervous, in part because we already have difficulties with completing a project;", 
    "if we have the opportunity to continue working on something forever, well, we just might.", 
    "On the other hand, would that necessarily be such a bad thing?", 
    "What if we were freed \u2014 by a necessary change in the ways that we \u2018credit\u2019 ongoing and in-process work \u2014 to shift our attention away from publication as the moment of singularity in which a text transforms from nothing into something, and instead focus on the many important stages in our work\u2019s coming-into-being?", 
    "What if we were able to think of our careers as writers in a more holistic sense, as an ongoing process of development, perhaps with some key moments of punctuation, rather than solely as a series of discrete closed projects, the return to the scene of which \u2014 whether in order to reveal changes in one\u2019s thinking about something one once committed to print or to take old material in new directions \u2014 seems somehow vaguely scandalous?", 
    "Such abilities would no doubt lead to work that was better thought-through, more \u2018significant,\u2019 in Waters\u2019s sense, but in order to take advantage of those abilities, we will first have to learn to value process over product, and to manifest that value in our assessments of one another\u2019s work.", 
    "Even more frighteningly, perhaps, we\u2019ll have to become willing to expose some of our process in public, to allow our readers \u2014 and our colleagues \u2014 to see some of the bumps and false starts along the way.", 
    "This, I will confess, is the aspect of my argument that I personally find the most alarming, and yet as soon as I admit to my own anxiety, I have to recognize that, through my blog, I\u2019ve long been doing some of this in-public work.", 
    "Many of the ideas in Planned Obsolescence, for instance, were first articulated in somewhat nebulous blog posts, clarified in discussions with commenters, expanded into conference papers and lectures, formalized into articles, and revised into chapters.", 
    "That process was absolutely key to the project\u2019s formation: I didn\u2019t at all have the sense, as I wrote those early blog posts, that I was embarking on a book-length project;", 
    "I only knew that I had a small, persistent question that I wanted to think a little bit about.", 
    "Having formulated an initial stab at one possible answer, having been disagreed with, supported, and encouraged by my commenters to think in more complex ways about the issues I\u2019d presented, only then was I able to recognize that there was more to be said, that there was something in the ideas to which I was compelled to commit myself.", 
    "Without the blog and the inadvertent process of drafting in public to which it led me, none of the ideas in the longer text could have come together.", 
    "This is not to say, of course, that every stage of this project was conducted in front of an audience, or that every academic blogger has experienced the same relationship between the in-public work of the blog and the more traditionally private work of scholarly writing.", 
    "My interest in the possibilities that versioning could present for shifting our focus in writing from product to process is not meant to suggest that every author need expose every draft of every sentence online, in real time.", 
    "What constitutes a \u2018version,\u2019 and at what stage it is made public, will be, and indeed ought to be, different for each author.", 
    "But approaching our writing from the perspective of process, thinking about how ideas move and develop from one form of writing to the next, and about the ways that those stages are represented, connected, preserved, and \u2018counted\u2019 within new digital modes of publishing, will be necessary for fostering work that takes full advantage of the web\u2019s particular temporality.", 
    "Everything published on the web exists, in some sense, in a perpetual draft state, open to future change;", 
    "we need to recognize both the need this creates for careful preservation of the historical record of the stages in a text\u2019s life and the equal importance for authors of approaching our work openly, thinking about how our texts might continue to grow even after they\u2019ve seen the light of day.", 
    "From originality to remix As our texts become increasingly available for this sort of ongoing development, however, we need to recognize the degree to which we may no longer be the sole authors working on them.", 
    "Our work is likely to become far more collaborative than it has been in the past, and new modes of collaboration \u2013 over time, across distances \u2013 made possible by networked writing structures are likely to require us to think about originality quite differently, precisely because of the ways that these new modes intervene in our conventional associations of authorship with individuality.", 
    "These two facets of conventional authorship \u2014 individuality and originality \u2014 are complexly intertwined: insisting that a text must consist of one\u2019s \u2018own\u2019 work is to insist that it make an original contribution to the field;", 
    "the bottom that every tub sits on must not simply be its own, but uniquely its own.", 
    "But not only does the operation of the digital network exclude the possibility of uniqueness in its very function \u2014 the web page I open in my browser window is never the document itself, but a copy of the document, and, in fact, my browser\u2019s representation of a copy of the document \u2014 but the links and interconnections that the network facilitates profoundly affect the shape of any given text.", 
    "If, in digital scholarship, the relationships between the authors whose ideas we draw upon (now traditionally cordoned off from our own ideas via quotation marks and citations) and the texts that we produce in response are made material \u2014 if the work of our predecessors is some sense contained within whatever increasingly fuzzy boundaries draw the outlines of our own texts \u2014 how can we demarcate the thing that constitutes our own contribution to the discourse?", 
    "How can our texts possibly remain unique, discrete, and original in an environment so thoroughly determined by the copy?", 
    "The historical formation of the notion of authorship in modern literary culture has of course held originality among its key values.", 
    "As Rafaelle Simone (1996) argues, the closed text that we associate with print carries with it several key assumptions;", 
    "one of these assumptions, which appears to be a common-sense, baseline prerequisite for publication, is that the text, \u2018assumed to be perfectum, has also to be original, and the well-educated reader takes it for granted that this is the case.", 
    "The reader assumes that the text derives wholly or mainly from the author\u2019s ideational effort and that the author has distinguished himself or herself from the work carried out by others, even if he or she cannot disregard the existence of texts by others\u2019.", 
    "It\u2019s thus not enough that the text be self-contained;", 
    "it also has to be new, springing entirely from the head of the author, and always distinguishing itself from the writing of other authors.", 
    "Digital technologies, however, force us to reconsider these presuppositions with respect to the published text;", 
    "writing within the network may both be published and yet, at the very same time, incomplete, remaining open to continued revision.", 
    "Further, the openness of the digital text implies potential openness in our attribution of authorship, while the closed text carries with it certain ownership rights, including the reservation to the author of the ability to re-open and revise a text.", 
    "Those ownership rights are accompanied by a number of responsibilities, including the obligation to \u2018distinguish the original parts (= resulting entirely from his or her own invention) from those which are not original (= resulting from the invention of others)\u2019.", 
    "These two assumptions \u2014 that the only author of a text is its named author, and that the author has scrupulously given credit for any borrowings \u2014 together produce the borders of our notion of plagiarism, an idea that \u2018cannot be applied to the author who copies him or herself;", 
    "only by plagiarizing someone else does plagiarism exist\u2019.", 
    "The specter of plagiarism makes clear that some of our anxiety about originality in our writing has to do with the dangers presented by its potential failure: we as scholars, as the producers of closed texts, are permitted to interact with the texts of others only in a passive, clearly designated fashion \u2014 and, by extension, others can only interact with our texts in a similar manner.", 
    "Such is one of the most crucial assumptions of the print-based modern literary system.", 
    "But as the dominant mode of text delivery shifts from the read-only structure of print to the read-write structure of digital technologies, can this assumption of authorial primacy, and its attendant pressures toward pure originality, continue to make sense?", 
    "It\u2019s important to note, of course, that the kind of closed text that we associate with contemporary authorship has not always been the norm;", 
    "numerous other modes of textual production \u2014 Simone points to the compilation, the miscellany, and the commentary \u2014 have at various times come into popular circulation, and have even at particular historical moments become the dominant form that authorship practices have taken.", 
    "These forms, in which the words of others achieve pre-eminence over the voice of the author him- or herself, indicate not only that our notion of authorship is \u2018not native and does not originate together with the texts (not even the written ones),\u2019 instead waxing and waning with changing historical circumstances, but also that, under certain of those circumstances, originality presents itself not as a virtue to be sought, but instead a danger to be avoided: \u2018Theoretic and doctrinal innovation is created only through small increases, per additamenta, through additions, always gradual and suitably apportioned.", 
    "If the text is original and evinces its own claim to originality, it risks being untenable.", 
    "Originality is dangerous.", 
    "The preferred act of authorship, under such circumstances, is that of bringing together the words of others, such that their juxtapositions, harmonies and dissonances, might produce an argument by implication.", 
    "I do not want to suggest that we are in such an era today, in which originality has become once again dangerous;", 
    "our very language reveals through its connotations our preference for the original over the derivative.", 
    "On the other hand, I do want to suggest that we no longer inhabit a world in which originality reigns unchallenged.", 
    "Challenges to the premium placed on originality have been raised by theorists of authorship for some decades, dating back to Roland Barthes: \u2018We know now that a text consists not of a line of words, releasing a single \u2018theological\u2019 meaning (the \u2018message\u2019 of the AuthorGod), but of a multi-dimensional space in which are married and contested several writings, none of which is original: the text is a fabric of quotations, resulting from a thousand sources of culture\u2019.", 
    "Barthes refers here not simply to literal miscellanies or other compilations drawing together pieces of many texts, but to all writing;", 
    "every text is \u2018a fabric of quotations,\u2019 whether its author is conscious of such borrowings or not, as the language that we use is never our creation, but rather that which has created us.", 
    "Similarly, Julia Kristeva\u2019s development, during the same period, of the notion of \u2018intertextuality\u2019 suggests that even the most ostensibly \u2018original\u2019 of texts is in fact rife with references to other texts, and that it is in fact impossible for a reader to approach any given text without reference to everything she has previously read or seen.", 
    "Such intertextuality becomes even more pronounced in the era of digital networks, as the structure of the hyperlink causes every text in the network to become part of every text that links to it, and thus each text is completed by every other, and becomes raw material for every other.", 
    "Scholars of hypertext have long explored the ability of the link to make material the previously implicit relationships amongst texts, but in more recent days, scholars in media studies have explored another form of authorship within digital culture which consciously focuses upon the bringing together of that \u2018fabric of quotations,\u2019 under the umbrella of the remix or the mashup.", 
    "Within the sphere of music, these forms have roots in the Jamaican culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s, attaining broad penetration through the sampling practices of hip-hop artists from the 1970s forward.", 
    "The phenomenon of the audio mashup may have achieved its greatest prominence with the release in 2004 of Danger Mouse\u2019s The Grey Album, a coupling of Jay Z\u2019s The Black Album with The Beatles, more commonly referred to as The White Album.", 
    "More broadly, however, remixes and mashups of multiple media forms have become a significant feature of internet-based fan culture, as inexpensive and widely available audio and video editing tools and a proliferation of digitally available texts have encouraged the grassroots production of new kinds of content from the raw materials of the media.", 
    "The question remains, however, whether such remix culture might fruitfully influence our own scholarly authorship practices.", 
    "If, as Rafaelle Simone puts it, the moment is coming when \u2018the protective membrane of the texts [we produce] will decompose and they will once more become open texts as in the Middle Ages with all the standard concomitant presuppositions\u2019, we might be well served in considering the ways that our authorship practices might be affected.", 
    "We might, for instance, find our values shifting away from a sole focus on the production of unique, original new arguments and texts to consider instead curation as a valid form of scholarly activity, in which the work of authorship lies in the imaginative bringing together of multiple threads of discourse that originate elsewhere, a potentially energizing form of argument via juxtaposition.", 
    "Such a practice of scholarly remixing might look a bit like blogging, in its original sense: finding the best of what has been published in the digital network and bringing it together, with commentary, for one\u2019s readership.", 
    "But it might also resemble a posthoc mode of journal or volume editing, creating playlists, of sorts, that bring together texts available on the web in ways that produce new kinds of interrelationships and analyses among them.", 
    "The key, as usual, will be convincing ourselves that this mode of work counts as work \u2014 that the editorial or curatorial work of bringing together texts and ideas might in the age of the network be worth as much to us, and perhaps even more, than the production of new texts.", 
    "As I\u2019ve argued in exploring new models for peer review online, the greatest labor involved in transforming the Internet into a venue for the publication of serious scholarship may well be that of post-publication filtering \u2014 seeing to it that the best and most important new work receives the attention it deserves.", 
    "Moreover, much of the writing we currently produce serves this same function, if in different form: recuperating overlooked texts, reframing past arguments, refuting earlier claims.", 
    "Today, in the current system of print-based scholarship, this work takes the form of reviews, essays, articles, editions;", 
    "tomorrow, as new mechanisms allow, these texts might be remixes, mashing up theories and texts to produce compelling new ideas.", 
    "From text to.", 
    ".", 
    ".", 
    "something more Other issues will of course arise as we start to open up our texts, not least among them concerns about intellectual property, as opening our texts to the intervention of other authors raises some quite serious questions about the \u2018ownership\u2019 of ideas and the relationship of such ownership to our authorship practices.", 
    "But as we open these texts to explore their networked environment, we\u2019re also likely to find that those texts change shape as well.", 
    "The expansion of our toolset via digital technologies will inevitably allow us to begin to shift our thinking about the mode of our work away from a uniform focus on the text-only formats that scholarship has traditionally taken, encouraging us instead to think about the ways that our work might interact with, include, and in fact be something more than just text.", 
    "This is of course not to suggest that everyone should be making YouTube videos instead of writing argumentative essays.", 
    "In fact, as Clifford Lynch has argued, there\u2019s a value in ensuring that most of our production in this new network age retains its recognizable, traditional form: Recently there has been a lot of thinking about how to devise intellectual successors to the scholarly monograph that specifically exploit the online environment.", 
    "One key idea is that while the definitive and comprehensive version of the work will be digital, there will also be a sensible (though impoverished) \u2018view\u2019 of the work that can be reduced to printed form as a traditional monograph.", 
    "This is critical in providing scholarly legitimacy in an intensively conservative environment that still distrusts the validity of electronic works of scholarship, and will thus be important in encouraging authors to create these new types of works.", 
    "It allows authors to exploit the greater expressiveness and flexibility of the digital medium without alienating colleagues who haven\u2019t yet embraced this medium.", 
    "As Lynch here suggests, ensuring that our new texts have a sort of reverse-compatibility with the structures of a fundamentally conservative academy has been important in the early stages of the transition to digital publishing;", 
    "print has served scholars well for the better part of 600 years, and however quickly the world around us seems to be changing, the academy may do well to be cautious in its embrace of the next new thing.", 
    "However, if we continue to focus our attention exclusively on the production of digital texts that can be translated, in whatever \u2018impoverished\u2019 way, into print, the range of our potential innovation will remain quite narrow.", 
    "The relative slowness of such change might be put in perspective by noting that Lynch made the claim above in 2001, and yet we remain in exactly the same position, with precious little in the way of forward movement toward thinking about new possible structures for the successor to the scholarly book;", 
    "we are still required to think of those successors in models that are analogous to print, when we might more productively start thinking of them as being far more multimodal.", 
    "What is it that I mean when I say \u2018multimodal\u2019?", 
    "Something more than simply multimedia;", 
    "it\u2019s not just a new relationship between text and image, or image and audio, or other forms of representation.", 
    "Those other forms are already embedded in many of the texts that we produce, and scholars have always been required to move ideas from one form to another in the process of writing.", 
    "Art historians, for instance, have long translated the visual into the textual in the process of analyzing it, and recently somewhat reduced costs of print production have enabled a more widespread inclusion of visual materials, without translation (or, rather, with a different form of translation), in the scholarly text.", 
    "But such inclusion remains a mode of illustration rather than production, by and large;", 
    "as Stuart Moulthrop has argued, academics cling tenaciously to an \u2018old separation of media, whereby all things not of the letter must be exchanged for letters in order to enter the system of learning\u2019.", 
    "We can thus write about images, but not in images;", 
    "we can write about video, but not in video.", 
    "As Moulthrop goes on to suggest, the clear separation among forms during previous eras of media transition made this possible;", 
    "there was never a threat that the film about which I wrote could somehow bleed into the words with which I wrote about it: This was good news for academics.", 
    "It was possible to study just about any medium through the miracle of content \u2014 by which we meant, written representations of our experience of the other medium \u2014 without having to become much more than auditors or spectators.", 
    "Among other things, this allowed the academy to draw a bright line between production work in various media (mere techne) and the writing of criticism and theory (the primary work of scholars).", 
    "With the coming of cybernetic communication systems \u2014 hypertext, the World Wide Web, soon now the Semantic Web \u2014 the conditions of all media are strongly transformed, and writing is clearly included.", 
    "Now, when my computer translates my words into the very same digital substance that sound, image, and other modes of representation exist in, we encounter the potential for a radical change, one that doesn\u2019t just break down the boundaries between text and video, for instance, allowing me to embed illustrative clips within the analysis I produce of them (this is the case that Moulthrop covers by saying that \u2018Writing is still writing, even with funkier friends\u2019), but that instead changes the fundamental nature of the analysis itself.", 
    "Numerous possibilities exist for this kind of change: remix culture, for instance, suggests that my analysis might itself take the form of video, producing a response to a cultural object in the same form as the object itself.", 
    "It\u2019s not too much of a stretch, after all, to argue that if authorship practices have changed, the very nature of writing itself has changed as well \u2014 not just our practices, but the result of those practices.", 
    "But there\u2019s something more.", 
    "At the beginning of this article, I made a number of claims about the significance for the process of academic writing of the technological shift from typewriter to word processor.", 
    "However, not only did that shift change whose hands were on the keyboard, and not only did it change the ways the thoughts that wind up in our texts come together, but it\u2019s also changed the very thing we wind up producing.", 
    "A mildly tendentious example, perhaps, but I think a significant one: rather than putting ink onto paper, when my fingers strike the keys, I\u2019m putting pixels onto a screen \u2014 and, it cannot be said clearly enough, the pixels on the screen are not my document, as anyone who has experienced a major word processor crash may be able to attest.", 
    "The image of my document on the screen of my computer is only a representation, and the text that I am actually creating as I type does not, in fact, look anything like it, or like the version that finally emerges from my printer.", 
    "The document that is produced from all this typing is produced only with the mediation of a computer program, which translates my typing into a code that very, very few of us will ever see (except in the case of rather unfortunate accident) and that even fewer of us could ever read.", 
    "On some level, of course, we all know this, though we\u2019re ordinarily exposed to the layers of code beneath the screen\u2019s representations only in moments of crisis;", 
    "computers that are functioning the way we want them to do so invisibly, translating what we write into something else in order to store that information, and then re-translating it in order to show it back to us, whether on screen or in print.", 
    "It\u2019s important to remain cognizant of this process of translation, because the computer is in some very material sense co-writing with us, a fact which presents us with the possibility that we might begin to look under the hood of the machine, to think about its codes as another mode of writing, and to think about how we might use those codes as an explicit part of our writing.", 
    "As Moulthrop says, \u2018when [John] Cayley opens the definition of writing to include programming, he registers a change in the status of the letter itself \u2014 crucially, a change that flows into writing from cybernetic media\u2019.", 
    "If \u2018the letter itself,\u2019 the smallest unit of our discourse, has been thus transformed by the computer that encodes and represents it to us, it\u2019s arguable that we need to begin wrestling with that encoding process itself, to understand code as a mode of writing, to become literate in markup/computer languages as well as human languages.", 
    "The thought of looking under the hood like this, of being asked to understand not simply another publishing format, but another language entirely, will no doubt result in new kinds of anxieties for some authors.", 
    "Perhaps we don\u2019t all need to become comfortable with code;", 
    "perhaps literacy in the computer age can remain, for most of us, at the level of the computer\u2019s representations to us, rather than at deeper layers of the computer\u2019s translations.", 
    "I raise the question of reading code, however, as a means of asking us to consider what a text is, and what it can be, in the digital age.", 
    "If we have the ability to respond to video with video, if we can move seamlessly from audio files to images to text as means of representing music, it may behoove us to think about exactly what it is we\u2019re producing when we write, how it is that these different modes of communication come together in complex new forms.", 
    "We need to think carefully about textual structures such as this in order to begin to understand the author who will arise in conjunction with these new forms, an author whose literacies and practices may diverge quite radically from those of the codex-oriented author we have long taken for granted."
